## 1. Business Understanding

Primary Objectives: - Joseph Likando  
1. To classify parliamentary rulings into a structured system that is simpler to analyze and 
evaluate  
2. Organize speakers' rulings to improve accessibility and quick retrieval for legal 
professionals, researchers, and public understanding.  

### Success Criteria from Business Perspective:  
- Reduce time spent by legal professionals searching for relevant rulings by at least 60% 
- Enable non-experts to find and understand parliamentary rulings relevant to their interests 
- Provide parliamentary staff with consistent categorization for improved procedural reference 
- Support academic and policy research through structured access to historical ruling patterns 

## 2. Data Mining Goals
**Specific Technical Objectives**  
1. **Build a Multi-class Classification Model:**  
   Develop a machine learning system that automatically categorizes Speaker's Rulings into predefined categories.

2. **Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  
   Apply text mining techniques to extract meaningful features from parliamentary text documents, enabling accurate classification.

3. **Create an Automated Classification Pipeline:**  
   Design and deploy a workflow that processes new Speaker's Rulings and assigns categories in real-time or batch mode.


## 3. Project Success Criteria
**Quantitative Criteria**  
1. **Model Performance:** Overall classification accuracy ≥ 80%
2. **Processing Speed:** System should classify new documents within 5 seconds
Business Impact Measures: - Jospeh likando
