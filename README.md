## 1. Business Understanding

Primary Objectives: - Joseph Likando  
1. To classify parliamentary rulings into a structured system that is simpler to analyze and 
evaluate  
2. Organize speakers' rulings to improve accessibility and quick retrieval for legal 
professionals, researchers, and public understanding.  


## 2. Data Mining Goals
**Specific Technical Objectives**  
1. **Build a Multi-class Classification Model:**  
   Develop a machine learning system that automatically categorizes Speaker's Rulings into predefined categories.

2. **Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  
   Apply text mining techniques to extract meaningful features from parliamentary text documents, enabling accurate classification.

3. **Create an Automated Classification Pipeline:**  
   Design and deploy a workflow that processes new Speaker's Rulings and assigns categories in real-time or batch mode.

# Technical Success Metrics 
* Accuracy: Achieve at least 80% overall classification accuracy across all ruling categories 
* Precision: Maintain precision above 75% for each individual category to ensure reliable 
categorization 
* F1-Score: Target F1-score above 77% for balanced precision-recall performance
## 3. Project Success Criteria
**Quantitative Criteria**  
1. **Model Performance:** Overall classification accuracy ≥ 80%
2. **Processing Speed:** System should classify new documents within 5 seconds
Business Impact Measures: - Jospeh likando 
• Reduction in manual categorization time 
• Increased usage of parliamentary information by researchers and citizens 
• Improved consistency in referencing past rulings by parliamentary staff 
• Enhanced accessibility of legal and legislative information for civic education
