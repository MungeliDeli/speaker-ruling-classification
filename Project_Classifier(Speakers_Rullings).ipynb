        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "The National Assembly of Zambia generates substantial volumes of parliamentary proceedings containing Speaker's Rulings on various procedural, disciplinary, and administrative matters. Currently, accessing and categorizing these rulings for legal research, parliamentary reference, and civic education requires extensive manual effort. Legal professionals, researchers, parliamentary staff, and citizens face significant challenges in efficiently locating relevant precedents and understanding patterns in parliamentary decision-making.\n",
        "### Core Problem:\n",
        "There is no automated system to classify and categorize Speaker's Rulings from Zambian parliamentary proceedings, making legal and legislative information retrieval inefficient and limiting effective civic education and parliamentary research.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Business Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "### Primary Objectives:\n",
        "1. To classify parliamentary rulings into a structured system that is simpler to analyze and\n",

        "2. Organize speakers' rulings to improve accessibility and quick retrieval for legal\n",
        "professionals, researchers, and public understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Success Criteria from Business Perspective:\n",
        "- Reduce time spent by legal professionals searching for relevant rulings by at least 60%\n",
        "- Enable non-experts to find and understand parliamentary rulings relevant to their interests\n",
        "- Provide parliamentary staff with consistent categorization for improved procedural reference\n",
        "- Support academic and policy research through structured access to historical ruling patterns\n",

        "   Develop a machine learning system that automatically categorizes Speaker's Rulings into predefined categories such as:\n",
        "    - **Procedural Rulings** (e.g., points of order, procedural motions)\n",
        "    - **Disciplinary Actions** (e.g., member conduct, sanctions)\n",
        "    - **Administrative Decisions** (e.g., scheduling, resource allocation)\n",
        "    - **Constitutional Interpretations** (e.g., constitutional questions, legal precedents)\n",
        "    - **Debate Management** (e.g., time allocation, speaking order)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  \n",
        "   Apply text mining techniques to extract meaningful features from parliamentary text documents, enabling accurate classification.\n",

        "2. **Processing Speed:** System should classify new documents within 5 seconds\n",
        "\n",
        "### Business Impact Measures:\n",
        "- Reduction in manual categorization time\n",
        "- Increased usage of parliamentary information by researchers and citizens\n",
        "- Improved consistency in referencing past rulings by parliamentary staff\n",

Hon Members, in his immediate response, the Hon Mr Second Deputy Speaker, reserved his ruling to study the matter. I have since studied the matter, and will now render my ruling.\\nHon Members, in order to address the Point of Order raised by Mr S Mushanga, MP, I had recourse to the verbatim record of the proceedings of Thursday, 21st July, 2022, pertaining to the Ministerial Statement on the Release and Utilisation of Constituency Development Fund. Mr S Mushanga, MP, on a point of clarification, asked the Hon Minister of Local Government and Rural Developmenton whetherthe Hon Minister would provide guidance on the possibility of allowing the respective CDF Committees, through the local authorities to procure vehicles for monitoring CDF projects and for policing purposes on behalf of the Ministry of Home Affairs and Internal Security.In response, Hon G G Nkombo, MP, stated that Bwacha Constituency did not have any approved CDF projects. It is as a result of this response that prompted Mr S Mushanga, MP, to raise a Point of Order.\\nHon Members, I further had recourse to the physical copy of the letter referred to by Mr S Mushanga, MP, in his Point of Order which he laid on the Table of the House. I noted that the letter was from the office of the Permanent Secretary in charge of Technical Services at the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development and addressed to the Town Clerk for the Kabwe Municipal Council.\\nHon Members, the office of the Permanent Secretary is a public body established under Article 184(1) of the Constitution of Zambia Act, Chapter 1 of the Laws of Zambia.Therefore, the letter that Mr S Mushanga, MP, relied upon in his Point of Order is a public document.\\nHon Members, when a member of the House refers to any document, he or she is expected to lay it on the Table.To this effect, Standing Order 139 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2021provides guidelines on the manner in which a backbencher may Table a public document in the House. Standing Order 139 states as follows:\\n\\u201c139 Tabling of Public Document by backbencher\\n(1) A backbencher may table a document provided it is an original document.\\n(2) A backbencher shall not table a copy of a public document unless the copy has been certified as a true copy of the original document by the relevant head of Government ministry, department or agency that has custody of the original document.\\u201d\\nHon Members, I had occasion to rule on a similar matter in thecase of Mr A C Mumba Member of Parliament for Kantanshi Parliamentary Constituency against Hon E C Nkandu, MP, Minister of Youth, Sport and Arts(Parliamentary Debates for Friday, 22nd October, 2021). In that case, Mr A C Mumba, MP asked whether the Hon Minister of Youth, Sport and Arts was in order to mislead the House that the National Internship and Apprenticeship Programme under his ministry would continue when the National Youth Development Council, which was responsible for the programme, had issued a letter indicating that the programme would end on 31st October, 2021. To this effect, Mr A C Mumba, MP, submitted to the Office of the Clerk an electronic copy of the letter referred to in his Point of Order. Mr Mumba, MP, did not Table the letter and neither was the letter authenticated by the author, as required by Standing Order 139. I, therefore, ruled the letter inadmissible, and consequently did not admit the Point of Order.\\nHon Members, back to the Point of Order in issue, Mr S Mushanga, MP, Tabled a letter purported to be from a public officer but the letter was not authenticated as required under Standing Order 139. Authentication of the letter is crucial to determining whether the Hon Minister of Local Government and Rural Development misinformed the House when he stated that Bwacha Constituency did not have any approved CDF projects.\\nTherefore, in line with Standing Order 139, the letter is inadmissible as it is not authenticated as required by our rules and, consequently, Mr Mushanga\\u2019s Point of Order is also inadmissible.\\nI Thank You.\",\n          \"I order you, Mr N Chilangwa, MP, to stand in your place.\\nHon Members, the House may wish to know that on 22nd June, 2023, the Chairperson of the Committee on Privileges and Absences received a letter from Hon S Mulusa, MP, Government Chief Whip, informing the Committee on Privileges and Absences of the continued absenteeism of Mr N Chilangwa, Member of Parliament for Kawambwa Constituency from sittings of the House. In the letter, Hon S Mulusa, MP, informed the Chairperson, that Mr N Chilangwa, MP, had been absent from the sittings of the House, without leave from either the Hon Madam Speaker or the office of the Government Chief Whip, from 6th June, 2023, when the House resumed its sittings. The complaint was premised on Standing Order No 210 (1) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2021. In line with parliamentary practice and procedure, and in accordance with the rules of natural justice, on Thursday, 6th July, 2023, the office of the Clerk of the National Assembly wrote to Mr N Chilangwa, MP, requesting him to state his side of the story on the matter. However, from Tuesday, 6th June to Saturday 15th July, 2023, Mr N Chilangwa, MP\\u2019s, whereabouts were unknown. Therefore, the office of the Clerk was unable to effect personal service on him as required by the law. A copy of the letter was, however, also sent to him via email and the WhatsApp messaging service. On Friday, 21st July, 2023, the Office of the Clerk received a response from Mr N Chilangwa, MP, dated 14th July, 2023. In his response, Mr N Chilangwa, MP, attributed his absence to the need for him to fulfill certain obligations in his constituency where he was needed more. He explained that he was unreachable because the affected areas of his constituency lacked a mobile phone network. He added that he only became aware of the matter against him after some of his constituents located him. He apologised for his conduct and undertook to ensure that such an incident did not repeat itself. He concluded his letter by stating that he was prepared to face whatever disciplinary action that would be meted out to him, as soon as possible, so that he could continue working for his constituents. Hon Members, the complaint by Hon S Mulusa, MP, raises the issue of a Member being absent from the sittings of the House without permission from the Speaker or the Government Chief Whip. Standing Order 229 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2021, provides that- \\u201c229. (1) A member seeking to be absent from a Sitting of the House shall seek the written permission of the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker in such form as the Speaker may determine, stating the period of absence, the reasons and any other relevant information. (2) The Government Chief Whip shall keep custody of requests for permission and may not disclose the information to third parties without the written consent of the Speaker.\\u201d\\nFurther, Standing Order 210 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders states as follows:\\n\\u201c210. (1) If, during a Session, a member is absent for four consecutive Sittings of the Assembly without permission, in writing, from the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker, the Government Chief Whip shall report the matter to the Committee on Privileges and Absences for hearing and determination. (2) If the committee finds that the member has offered a satisfactory explanation for the member's absence from Sittings of the Assembly, there shall be no further proceedings on the matter.\\n(3) If the committee finds that the member has not offered a satisfactory explanation for the member's absence from Sittings of the Assembly, the committee shall, through the Speaker, report to the House recommending appropriate action to be taken against the member.\\u201d\\nAdditionally, eminent authors on parliamentary practice and procedure, M N Kaul and S L Shakdher, in their book entitled Practice and Procedure of Parliament, Seventh Edition, (New Delhi, Lok Sabha, 2016) on page 425, have this to say:\\n\\u201cEach constituency expects that the member it elects will take his seat in the Lok Sabah and attend the sittings of the House, except when it is necessary for him to remain absent on account of unavoidable reasons. It is the right of the Lok Sabha to receive from him an account as to why he was absent. The duty of members to the House is paramount and they are expected to remain absent from the sittings thereof only when there are compelling reasons for doing so.\\u201d The erstwhile Speaker, Rt Hon Justice Patrick Matibini, SC, had occasion to rule on a similar matter in the case of Mr H Kalaba, former Member of Parliament for Bahati Constituency (Daily Parliamentary Debate of 10th July, 2018). In that matter, Mr H Kalaba, MP, was absent from the sittings of the House for eighteen (18) sitting days without permission. On 19th March, 2018, Hon S Chungu, MP, Chief Whip, as he then was, wrote to Mr H Kalaba, MP, regarding his absence from the House. In response, Mr H Kalaba, MP, explained that his absence from the House was because he had lost eight (08) members of his constituency on Lake Bangweulu and had spent about fifteen (15) days in his constituency mourning with the deceased\\u2019s families. He added that he had notified Mr J Chabi, Member of Parliament for Chipili Constituency, of the situation and had requested him to convey the reasons for his absence from the House to the Chief Whip. Regrettably that information did not reach the Chief Whip. He, further, stated that his absence from the House was neither deliberate nor intended to undermine the Office of the Chief Whip or the decorum and etiquette of the House. The matter was referred to the Committee on Privileges, Absences and Support Services, as it then was, for determination. The Committee, upon deliberation of the matter, found that Mr H Kalaba\\u2019s conduct of being absent from eighteen (18) sittings of the House, without prior permission of either the Hon Mr Speaker or Chief Whip, was a breach of parliamentary privilege.\\nIn deciding which punishment to mete out to Mr H Kalaba, the Committee noted that Standing Order 151 (3), at the time, only provided two options; reprimand or suspension. The Committee also considered the fact that Mr H Kalaba, MP, had readily admitted that he had breached the rules of the House and, therefore, did not waste its time. Additionally, he had shown remorse for his misconduct. The committee further considered its decision in the Miles Sampa case, whose facts were similar to Mr H Kalaba\\u2019s case. In view of those considerations, the committee exercised leniency and resolved that Mr H Kalaba, MP, be reprimanded.\\nHon Members, in this matter, the Committee on Privileges and Absences met to consider the matter on Tuesday, 10th October, 2023. Both the complainant and the respondent appeared before the Committee and stated their side of the story. Hon S Mulusa, MP, informed the Committee that Mr N Chilangwa, MP\\u2019s absence from the sittings of the House, without the permission from either the Hon Madam Speaker or the Government Chief Whip, prompted him to report the matter to the Committee as required by standing order 210. In response, Mr N Chilangwa, MP, admitted to having been absent from the sittings of the National Assembly without permission from either the Hon Madam Speaker or the Government Chief Whip for a period of seven (7) days. He submitted that at the time of the complaint, he was in his constituency attending to urgent matters and some other personal issues. He added that these factors had made it impossible for him to attend sittings of the House and that his absence was due to circumstances beyond his control. Finally, Mr N Chilangwa, MP, apologised for his actions and implored the Committee to exercise leniency when determining his matter. Hon Members, in considering this matter, the Committee had regard to the letter of complaint, Mr N Chilangwa, MP\\u2019s response and the oral submissions by both parties. The Committee found that Mr N Chilangwa, MP, had been absent from sittings of the House for a total of twenty-three (23) sitting days. He was, therefore, found guilty of breaching standing orders 210 and 229 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders.\\nHon Members, the Committee deliberated on the appropriate punishment to mete out to Mr N Chilangwa, MP. In its deliberations, the Committee took into consideration the following issues: (1) he readily admitted that he had breached the rules of the House and therefore, had not wasted the Committee\\u2019s time; (2) he readily apologised for his conduct and was ready to be punished for it;\\n(3) he was remorseful both in his oral and written submissions; (4) there were extenuating circumstances that surrounded his absenteeism from the House;\\n(5) the matter was in the public domain and had attracted a lot of attention;\\n(6) a select committee had been appointed to scrutinise the matter and, therefore, it was in the interest of all parties that the matter be settled in a manner that would bring closure; and\\n(7) in the precedents relating to the absence of Mr H Kalaba and Mr M Sampa, MP, for eighteen (18) days and twenty-two (22) days, respectively, the two Members of Parliament were reprimanded because, at that time, there were only two punishment options available; that was, reprimand and suspension. In contrast, in the present matter, the Committee had more punishment options available to it. Additionally, the circumstances surrounding the member\\u2019s absence were beyond his control and warranted the leniency of the Committee. The matter was, therefore, distinguishable from the Kalaba and Sampa cases.\\nHon Members, after due consideration of the above factors, the Committee exercised leniency and resolved to recommend that Mr N Chilangwa, MP, be admonished. I fully endorse the Committee\\u2019s recommendation.\\nTherefore, in line with the recommendation of the Committee on Privileges and Absences, I now turn to address you, Mr N Chilangwa, MP. Mr N Chilangwa, MP, in order for you to effectively and efficiently perform your role as a Member of Parliament, you are required to be in the House at all times, except when permission is sought for you to be absent. According to the Members\\u2019 attendance record for the last Meeting of the House, you were absent from the House for twenty-three sitting days. As a long-standing Member of this House, you should know that absenteeism of a Member from the House, for such a prolonged period without permission of the Speaker or Government Chief Whip reflects adversely on the dignity and integrity of the House. Mr N Chilangwa, MP, your absence for such a long period was a serious error of judgment on your part and amounted to an abandonment of your duties not only to this House, but also to the people of Kawambwa Constituency whom you represent and to the nation at large. I, therefore, urge you to, in future, desist from such conduct. I trust that, in future, you will endeavor to abide by the rules of this House and avoid the consequences of their breach. A repetition of such conduct will attract a stiffer penalty. I now order you, Mr N Chilangwa, MP, to read your apology and, thereafter resume your seat.\\nI thank you.\\n_______________________\\nRuling Date: Friday, November 3, 2023\",\n          \"Hon Members will recall that on Wednesday, 7th June, 2023, when the House was considering Matters of Urgent Public Importance, Mr Munir Zulu, Member of Parliament for Lumezi Constituency, raised a matter of urgent public importance on the practice by the Zambia Police Service of waiting for Members of Parliament outside parliament grounds and arresting them without issuing call-outs, which, he referred to as abduction. He mentioned Mr C Shakafuswa, Member of Parliament for Mandevu Constituency, Mr R K Kalimi, Member of Parliament for Malole Constituency and himself as some members who had been abducted in such a manner. He, therefore, sought clarity on the matter.\\n\\nIn my immediate response, I requested Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security to provide a response to the issues raised by Mr Munir Zulu, MP. In response, Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, stated that Members of Parliament did not have immunity on criminal matters. He further stated that there was no Member of Parliament who had been abducted and that every arrest of a Member of Parliament had been based on allegations against such Member. \\n\\nHon Members, after a protracted debate on the matter, I reserved my ruling to enable me provide guidance to the House on the arrest of Members of Parliament on or off the precincts of the National Assembly. \\n\\nHon Members, I now proceed to render my guidance.\\n\\nHon Members, the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, Cap. 12 of the Laws of Zambia, among other things, grants Members of Parliament various immunities. These include the freedom from arrest, which is provided under section 5. Section 5 states as follows:\\n\\n\\u201c5. For the duration of a meeting members shall enjoy freedom from arrest for any civil debt except a debt the contraction of which constitutes a criminal offence.\\u201d\\n\\nFrom the foregoing authority, the following is clear: \\nMembers are only exempt from arrest for a civil debt and not a debt whose contraction constitutes a criminal offence;\\nThis exemption is only available when the House is in session; and\\nMembers are not exempt from arrest for a criminal offence.\\n\\nHon Members, having established that Members have no immunity from arrest for criminal offences, allow me to draw your attention to section 5A of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, which provides that- \\n\\u201cWhere a member is arrested for a criminal offence, the arresting officer shall inform the Speaker of the arrest within forty-eight hours of the arrest.\\u201d\\n\\nFrom the foregoing authorities, it is evident that Members of Parliament can be arrested for a criminal offence while parliament is in session either off or on the precincts of the Assembly. However, once a Member of Parliament has been arrested, the arresting officer must notify me of the arrest within 48 hours.\\n\\nHon Members, the manner and form of arrest by police officers is laid out in the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 88 of the Laws of Zambia, whose interpretation is the preserve of the courts. I, therefore, cannot delve into whether the arrests complained of by Mr Munir Zulu, MP, were carried out in compliance with the law. \\n\\nI thank you.\\n_____________________\\n\\nRuling Date: \\nWednesday, June 21, 2023\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"context\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"complaint\",\n          \"matter of urgent public importance\",\n          \"point of order\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"categories\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"constitutional interpretations, disciplinary actions\",\n          \"constitutional interpretations, procedural rulings\",\n          \"debate management, procedural rulings\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"standingOrder\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 65,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"4\",\n          \"27\",\n          \"139\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In addition, Mr Nkombo, MP, made reference to a letter from the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) addressed to all Members of Parliament regarding the National Health Insurance Bill.\\nMr Nkombo, MP, specifically asked whether Dr Chanda, MP, who was a member of the Committee considering the Bill, was in order to campaign for the Bill when he knew very well that the proceedings of the Committee were supposed to be confidential until the Committee had tabled its report in the House.\\nHon Members, on the same day, my office received a letter of complaint from the Zambia Federation of Employers relating to the same matter. The Federation expressed shock that soon after it made its submission to the Committee considering the Bill, Dr Chanda, MP, went to the media to campaign for the Bill before its report was tabled in the House, and yet he was a member of the Committee considering the Bill.\\nIn my immediate response to the Point of Order, I reserved the ruling to enable me study the matter and render an informed ruling. I now wish to render the ruling.\\nHon Members, the Point of Order relates to a Member of Parliament publicly commenting on a matter under consideration by a Committee to which he or she is a member before the report of the Committee is tabled.\\nThe National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, Chapter 12 of the Laws of Zambia prohibits Members of Parliament from disclosing information submitted to the Assembly before it has been laid on the table of the House.\\nIn this regard, section 25 (c) provides as follows:\\n\\u201c25 (c) Any person who publishes, save by general or special leave of the Assembly, any paper, report or other document prepared expressly for submission to the Assembly before the same has been laid on the Table of the Assembly shall be guilty of an offence.\\u201d\\nAlso, Chapter Ten of the National Assembly Members\\u2019 Handbook, 2006, at page 51 in paragraph \\u201co\\u201d provides:\\n\\u201cAll Committee reports are confidential until the Report is tabled.\\u201d\\nIn addition, M N Kaul and S L Shakdher, the learned authors of Practice and Procedure in Parliament, Seventh Edition, (New Delhi, Lok Sabha, 2016) state at page 308 as follows:\\n\\u201cIt is a breach of privilege and contempt of the House to publish any part of the proceedings or evidence given before, or any document presented to a Parliamentary Committee before such proceedings, or evidence or documents have been reported to the House.\\u201d\\nFurther, at page 309 of the same book, the Committee of Privileges of Lok Sabha is reported to have re-stated this position in the Indian case of Sundaraya, when it stated as follows:\\n\\u201cIt is in accordance with the law and practice of the privileges of Parliament that while a Committee of Parliament is holding its sittings from day to day, its proceedings should not be published nor any documents or papers which may have been presented to the Committee or the conclusions to which it may have arrived at referred to in the Press\\u2026\\nIt is highly desirable that no person, including a Member of Parliament or Press, should, without proper verification, make or publish a statement or comment about any matter which is under consideration or investigation by a Committee of Parliament.\\u201d All the foregoing authorities point to the fact that, prior to a report being tabled in the House, a Member cannot divulge information that he or she receives by virtue of being a member of the Committee or comment publicly on a matter before a Committee without obtaining permission from the House.\\nHon Members, it is common knowledge that the Constitution under Article 89, now requires the National Assembly to facilitate public involvement in the legislative process. It is also a well known fact that the National Assembly does this through referring Bills to Committees after the First Reading Stage, and inviting the public to submit on them. In addition, Bills are uploaded on the National Assembly website. More importantly, the proceedings of Committees considering Bills are broadcast on both Parliament Radio and Parliament TV. All these measures ensure the public is kept informed on Bills before the House.\\nHon Members, I am aware that as the people\\u2019s representatives, Members of Parliament have a role to sensitise their constituents and the public at large on the contents and ramifications of Bills that come before the House. However, the timing at which this is done is key. This is particularly so for members sitting on the Committee considering the Bill.\\nAs you are well aware, before a Bill is brought to the House, it is published in the Government Gazette. That makes it a public document and members can, at that time, freely sensitise the public on its content. However, once a Bill has been referred to a Committee in which you are a member, you cannot, without leave of the House, divulge information on the Committee\\u2019s deliberations on the Bill to the public or publicly comment on a Bill being considered by a Committee before its report is tabled in the House. In this regard, a member of a Committee who, while the Committee is considering a matter, goes to a public forum to discuss it runs the risk of falling foul of section 25 (c).\\nIn the instant case, the National Health Insurance Bill was published in the Government Gazette on Wednesday, 6th December, 2017 through Gazette Notice No. 863 of 2017. On Friday 8th December, 2017 the Bill was read the first time and referred to the Committee on Health, Community Development and Social Services for consideration. The Committee considered the Bill from 9th to 16th February, 2018. Thus, the Committee adopted its report on Friday 16th February, 2018. The report was tabled in the House on Monday 26th February, 2016.\\nHon Members, looking at this timeline, it is evident that Dr J Chanda, MP, had sufficient time to sensitise the public on the Bill before the Committee commenced its sittings. This is because the Bill was gazetted on 6th December, 2017, and the Committee only began sitting on 9th February, 2018, which is exactly two (2) months later. It is further evident that by the time the Hon Member addressed the PF Interactive Forum on Monday, 19th February, 2018, the Committee had concluded receiving evidence from witnesses and had adopted its report. He, in this regard, went to a public forum to canvass support for the Bill, knowing well that the Committee did not support the Bill and had recommended that it be deferred for further consultations.\\nHon Members, I carefully reviewed the documents and the video in the flash disk laid on the table by Mr G G Nkombo, MP. The video clip shows Dr Chanda, MP, addressing a Patriotic Front Forum and urging the attendees to support the National Health Insurance Bill. As a member of the Committee that considered the Bill, it was most inappropriate for him to go to a public forum to solicit support for the Bill, after all the witnesses that had been invited by the Committee had made their submissions and before the Committee\\u2019s report was tabled. Dr Chanda, MP, ought to know that commenting on the proceedings of a committee before its report is tabled is an offence under section 25 (c) of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act.\\nHon Members, in view of the foregoing, I find Dr Chanda, MP, in breach of parliamentary privilege and in contempt of the House. While this is an offence under section 25 (c) of the Act and a serious breach of the rules of the House, I recognise the fact that Dr J Chanda, MP, is a first offender. In this regard, I have decided to exercise leniency and admonish him in accordance with section 28 (1) (b) of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act.\\nI now order you, Dr J Chanda, MP, to stand in your place. Dr J Chanda, your conduct of addressing a public forum on a Bill before the House while you were a Member of the Committee considering the Bill and before the Committee\\u2019s report could be tabled in the House was a breach of parliamentary privileges and a contempt of the House. As a member of the Committee that considered the Bill, you had full knowledge of the stakeholders\\u2019 and Committee\\u2019s sentiments on the Bill. It was, therefore, extremely inappropriate for you to address a public forum to solicit support for the Bill. The House is, in this regard, extremely disappointed with your conduct. It is hoped that, in future, you will endeavour to abide by the rules of this House and avoid such conduct. Please, bear in mind that a repetition of such conduct will attract a stiffer penalty.\\nI thank you\\nRuling Date: Thursday, March 15, 2018\\nParliamentary Period: Second Session of the Twelfth Assembly\",\n          \"disciplinary actions, procedural rulings\",\n          \"RULING BY THE HON MR SPEAKER ON A POINT OF ORDER RAISED BY MR G G NKOMBO, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR MAZABUKA CENTRAL PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUENCY, AGAINST DR J CHANDA, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR BWANA MKUBWA PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUENCY ON TUESDAY, 20TH FEBRUARY, 2018\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": 141,\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Hon Members will recall that on Tuesday, 3rd October, 2017, when the House was considering Question for Oral Answer No. 41 and the Hon Member of Parliament for Bweengwa Parliamentary Constituency, Mr K Michelo, MP, was asking a follow-up Question, Hon J Kapata, MP, Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, raised a Point of Order alleging that Dr C Kambwili, MP, had accused her of stealing money through the sale of Mukula tree and had been calling her a thief on radio stations and in other print and electronic media.\\nIn my immediate remarks, I reserved my ruling on the matter. I later referred the matter to the Committee on Privileges, Absences and Support Services for consideration.\\nThe Committee on Privileges, Absences and Support Services met to consider the matter. In line with parliamentary practice and procedure, and in accordance with the rules of natural justice, both the Hon Minister and Dr C Kambwili, MP, appeared before the Committee to make their oral submissions on the matter.\\nIn submitting to the Committee, the Hon Minister re-stated her complaint as contained in the Point of Order; that is, she referred to the alleged utterances of Dr Kambwili, MP, reported in the print and electronic media where he alleged that Hon Kapata, MP, was a thief. She asked the Committee to request Dr Kambwili, MP, to provide evidence that she was a thief and demanded for an apology from Dr Kambwili, MP.\\nFurther, Hon Kapata, MP, informed the Committee that she was in the process of commencing legal proceedings against Dr Kambwili, MP, over the matter. In that regard, she submitted that her lawyers had since written to Dr Kambwili, MP, requesting him to retract his defamatory statements against the Hon Minister within seven (7) days. She submitted that since Dr Kambwili, MP, had not responded to the letter, her lawyers would proceed to commence court action against him.\\nOn the other hand, Dr Kambwili, MP, when asked to respond to the Hon Minister\\u2019s complaint, submitted that he would not comment on what he had said on radio stations, as he was not bound to account for what he said outside the House to the House. He added that if Hon Kapata MP was injured by what he had said, she was at liberty to seek redress in the courts of law.\\nThe Committee deliberated on the matter and made the following findings:\\n(i) That the Hon Minister\\u2019s complaint was based on statements allegedly made by Dr Kambwili, MP, against her on radio stations and in other print and electronic media;\\n(ii) That Hon Kapata, MP, was in the process of commencing legal proceedings over the matter against Dr Kambwili, MP; and\\n(iii) That the statements complained of were not made in the House.\\nIn view of these findings, the Committee was in agreement that the alleged statements by Dr Kambwili, MP, against Hon Kapata, MP, were made outside the House and in the political arena. Therefore, the committee resolved that it could not dwell on the matter as it fell outside its jurisdiction. The Committee accordingly advised Hon Kapata, MP, to seek other avenues of redress available to her if she so wished. And I uphold the decision of the Committee.\\nI thank you.

In this regard, the Point of Order was flawed and ordinarily I would not have entertained it.\\nHowever, since it raises a novel issue, I have decided to seize this opportunity to give the House some guidance on the matter raised in the Point of Order.\\nHon Members, as you are well aware, it is prohibited for any person to wear or display any form of political party regalia on the precincts of Parliament. This is because the precincts of Parliament are not a place for political party activities or campaigns, but are a place where the people\\u2019s representatives converge to conduct the affairs of the entire nation. Further, allowing party regalia in the House can potentially result in unnecessary political conflict that will divert the attention of the House from serious business that it requires to transact.\\nHaving said that, I wish to state that wearing attire, whose colour is associated with a political party, but which does not bear any political party symbol or reference to that party does not amount to wearing party regalia. Hon Members, I carefully examined the photo that displays on the screen whenever Mr G G Nkombo, MP, speaks through his microphone. My examination revealed that while the shirt, indeed, appears to be in the United Party for National Development\\u2019s (UPND) signature colour; red, it does not bear any party symbol or indeed any reference to the UPND. In this regard, it is admissible. I, however, noted that the attire Hon G G Nkombo wore in the photo was quite informal. While there is no rule barring this, I wish to urge Hon Members to, as far as possible, submit photos that conform to the official dress code provided in Standing Order 165 whenever they are submitting photos for official use.\\nThat is my ruling.\\nI thank you.\\nRuling Date: Thursday, March 15, 2018\\nParliamentary Period: Second Session of the Twelfth Assembly\",\n          \"165\",\n          \"point of order\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The Point of Order was premised on Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution of Zambia, Chapter 1 of the Laws of Zambia, which provides for the vacation of Office as a Member of Parliament where a Member acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct.\\nIn his Point of Order, Dr C Andeleki, MP, stated that Mr J E Banda, Member of Parliament for Petauke Central Constituency, disappeared from Chipata Central Hospital on Thursday, 20th June, 2024, following his charge for Aggravated Robbery and Attempted Murder. In this regard, Dr C Andeleki, MP, enquired whether Mr J E Banda, MP, was still a Member of Parliament within the definition of section 2 of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, Chapter 12 of the Laws of Zambia, given that he had not appeared in the House since 20th June, 2024.\\nThe Hon Madam First Deputy Speaker rendered a ruling on Tuesday 5th November, 2024, wherein she referred the matter to Committee on Privileges and Absences for determination and for the Committee to make appropriate recommendations by Friday, 15th November, 2024. This decision was premised on Standing Order 223 (1) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, on a Member\\u2019s failure to attend sittings which provides that-\\n\\u201c223. (1) If, during a Session, a Member is absent for four or more consecutive Sittings of the Assembly without permission, in writing, from the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker, the matter shall stand referred to the Committee on Privileges and Absences for hearing and determination.\\u201d\\nTherefore, in line with parliamentary practice and procedure, and in accordance with the rules of natural justice, on Wednesday, 6th November, 2024, the Office of the Clerk wrote to Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, and Hon S Mulusa, MP, Government Chief Whip, to state what they know about the absence of Mr J E Banda, MP, since Thursday, 20th June, 2024. Additionally, on Monday, 11th November, 2024, the Office of the Clerk wrote to Dr C Andeleki, MP, to ask him what he knows about Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, absence. However, Mr J E Banda, MP, was not written to since his whereabouts were unknown.\\nThe responses from the witnesses are summarised below.\\n(i) DR C ANDELEKI, MP\\nDr C Andeleki, MP, in his letter of response dated 12th November, 2024, indicated that he was aware that Mr J E Banda, MP, was arrested on 20th June, 2024, for the offence of Aggravated Robbery and Attempted Murder. He stated that in August, 2024, Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, informed the country of the escape of Mr J E Banda, MP, from Chipata Central Hospital where he was receiving medical attention. He further indicated that since his disappearance, Mr J E Banda, MP, had not attended sittings of the House contrary to Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024. Lastly, he pointed out that the continued absence of Mr J E Banda, MP, was a breach of the code of conduct for Members, as such, a vacancy had occurred as per the provisions of Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution.\\n(ii) HON S MULUSA, MP\\nIn his response letter dated Tuesday, 12th November, 2024, Hon S Mulusa, MP, Government Chief Whip, stated that Mr J E Banda, MP, did not seek permission from his office for his absence. He also indicated that he did not know Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, whereabouts.\\n(iii) HON J J MWIIMBU, MP\\nIn a status report dated 11th November, 2024, Hon JJ Mwiimbu, MP, explained that on Sunday, 30th June, 2024, Mr J E Banda, MP, was arrested by the Zambia Police Service for an alleged aggravated robbery dating back to 14th December 2015, in Vubwi District. He indicated that Mr J E Banda, MP, was subsequently committed to the High Court for trial on 19th July, 2024, by the Chipata Magistrate Court and remanded at Namuseche Correctional Facility. He added that on Thursday, 1st August, 2024, Mr J E Banda, MP, fell ill and was taken to Chipata Central Hospital for treatment. Subsequently, three (3) correctional Service Officers and two (2) Zambia Police Officers were assigned to guard him. However, on Sunday, 4th August, 2024, between 21:00 and 22:00 hours, Mr J E Banda, MP, escaped through a hospital window despite being under a five (5) officer guard team. Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, explained that this occurred when Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s wife, requested privacy for him to undergo a routine treatment for his ailment. Further, he stated that investigations were ongoing to determine his whereabouts, including a manhunt, witness interviews, and an internal review of the officers' actions during the escape.\\nHon Members, Dr C Andeleki, MP's, Point of Order raises the issue of vacation of Office as a Member of Parliament where a Member acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct.\\nHon Members, Article 77(1) of the Constitution confers on the National Assembly, the power to regulate its own procedure and make Standing Orders for the conduct of its business. It states as follows:\\n\\u201c(1) Subject to this Article, and Article 78, the National Assembly shall regulate its own procedure and make Standing Orders for the conduct of its business.\\u201d\\nAdditionally, Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution provides as follows:\\n\\u201c(2) The Office of a Member becomes vacant if the member-\\n(a) \\u2026\\n(b) \\u2026\\n(c) acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct.\\u201d\\nFurther, Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, requires Members to seek permission to be absent and provides as follows:\\n\\u201c243. Permission to be Absent (1) A Member seeking to be absent from a Sitting of the House shall seek written permission of the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker in such form as the Speaker may determine, stating the period of absence, the reasons and any other relevant information.\\n(2) The Government Chief Whip shall keep custody of requests for permission and may not disclose the information to third parties without the written consent of the Speaker.\\u201d\\nIn addition, Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, on a Member\\u2019s failure to attend sittings provides that- \\u201c223. (1) If, during a Session, a Member is absent for four or more consecutive Sittings of the Assembly without permission, in writing, from the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker, the matter shall stand referred to the Committee on Privileges and Absences for hearing and determination.\\n(2) If the committee finds that the Member has offered a satisfactory explanation for the Member's absence from Sittings of the Assembly, there shall be no further proceedings on the matter.\\n(3) If the committee finds that the Member has not offered a satisfactory explanation for the member's absence from Sittings of the Assembly, the committee shall, through the Speaker, report to the House recommending appropriate action to be taken against the member.\\u201d\\nFurthermore, eminent authors on parliamentary practice and procedure, M N Kaul and S L Shakdher, in their book entitled Practice and Procedure of Parliament, Seventh Edition, (New Delhi, Lok Sabha, 2016) on page 425, have this to say:\\n\\u201cEach constituency expects that the member it elects will take his seat in the Lok Sabha and attend the sittings of the House, except when it is necessary for him to remain absent on account of unavoidable reasons. It is the right of the Lok Sabha to receive from him an account as to why he was absent. The duty of members to the House is paramount and they are expected to remain absent from the sittings thereof only when there are compelling reasons for doing so.\\u201d From the above authorities, it is evident that a Parliamentary seat is rendered vacant when a Member acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct. In casu, the prescribed code of conduct alleged to have been breached is Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, on a Member's requirement to seek permission from the relevant authorities.\\nHon Members, the Committee met on Wednesday, 13th November, 2024, to deliberate on this matter. Three witnesses, Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, Mr S Mulusa, MP, Government Chief Whip, and Dr C Andeleki, MP, appeared before the Committee to make oral submissions. Their submissions are as set out below.\\n(i) DR C ANDELEKI, MP\\nDr C Andeleki, MP, relied on his written submission. In summary, he stated that Mr J E Banda, MP, had been absent from the sittings of the House since 20th June, 2024, prompting him to raise a Point of Order. He indicated that Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, continued absence breached Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, and was deemed to have vacated his seat under Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution.\\n(ii) HON S MULUSA, MP\\nHon S Mulusa, MP, reiterated that Mr J E Banda, MP, did not seek permission from his office for his absence. He added that he was not in receipt of information on Mr J E Banda, MP, from his proxy or family member, as such, he did not know Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, whereabouts. When asked why his Office did not deal with the matter expeditiously, Hon S Mulusa, MP, stated that the matter involving Mr J E Banda, MP, was criminal in nature and that he was under lawful custody until his escape. In this regard, his Office could not intervene.\\n(iii) HON J J MWIIMBU, MP\\nHon J J Mwiimbu, MP, reiterated what he stated in his written submission. However, he expressed hope of locating Mr J E Banda, MP, in due course. Hon Members, in its deliberations, the Committee noted that if Mr J E Banda, MP, was found to have been absent without permission, the Committee could not impose penalties under Standing Order 223 (4) of the National Assembly Standing Orders, 2024, due to his unknown whereabouts and inability to appear before it. Therefore, in dealing with this matter, the Committee observed that it had the following recommendation options:\\n(i) for the Office of the Speaker to instruct the Attorney-General to commence legal action in the Constitutional Court to have the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat declared vacant for breach of a prescribed code of conduct as provided under Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution of Zambia, Chapter 1 of the Laws of Zambia; or\\n(ii) for the Member to be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failure to which the Hon Madam Speaker should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat.\\nHon Members, after considering the written and oral submissions from the witnesses, the Committee observed as follows:\\n(i) that Mr J E Banda, MP, had been absent without permission since 4th August, 2024;\\n(ii) that his absence without permission breached the prescribed code of conduct, that is, Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024;\\n(iii) that the Petauke Central constituents had been unrepresented since June, 2024, thus, it was in the constituents\\u2019 best interest to have representation in the Assembly; (iv) that due to Mr J E Banda, MP's unknown whereabouts, pursuing legal action through the Attorney-General was impractical as the rules of natural justice would not be attained; and\\n(v) that in line with the rules of natural justice, it was important for Mr J E Banda, MP, to be accorded an opportunity to attend the sittings of the House, failure to which the Hon Madam Speaker should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution.\\nIn view of the foregoing, and in line with parliamentary practice and procedure, and in accordance with the rules of natural justice, the Committee unanimously resolved to recommend that Mr J E Banda, MP, be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failing which my Office should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat. Hon Members, I have considered the recommendations of the Committee. I note, however, that there is no legal requirement for the House to pass a resolution to endorse the recommendations of the Committee. Nonetheless, due to the peculiar circumstances and gravity of this matter, there is need for this House to pass a resolution on the course of action to be taken against Mr J E Banda, MP.\\nI now put the Question: The Question is, that Mr J E Banda, MP, be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failing which my Office should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat. As many as are of that opinion say \\u2018Aye\\u2019;\\n(Pause)\\nOf the contrary say \\u2018No\\u2019;\\nSCENARIO 1\\nI think the \\u2018Ayes\\u2019 have it. [Pause]. The \\u2018Ayes\\u2019 have it. The question is resolved in the affirmative.\\nI will now proceed to address Mr J E Banda, MP, in absentia. Mr J E Banda, MP, you have seven (7) days from today, Tuesday, 19th November, 2024, to Tuesday, 26th November, 2024, within which to attend the business of the House. Should you fail to attend the business of the House within this period, I shall in line with Article 72 (8) of the Constitution proceed to inform the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat.\\nSCENARIO 2\\nI think the \\u2018Noes\\u2019 have it. [pause]. The \\u2018Noes\\u2019 have it. The question is negatived.\",\n          \"Honourable Members will recall that on Tuesday, 12th November, 2024, when the House was considering the Report of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Human Rights and Governance on the Accession of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Aiming at the Abolition of the Death Penalty and Mr H Mapani, Member of Parliament for Namwala Constituency was debating, Honourable M Haimbe, MP, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, raised a Point of Order. In his Point of Order, Honourable M Haimbe, MP, inquired whether Mr Munir Zulu, Member of Parliament for Lumezi Constituency, was in order to use a derogatory term whilst pointing at Members of Parliament on the right side of the Speaker, while debating. Honourable Members, in her immediate response, the Honourable Madam First Deputy Speaker reserved her ruling in order to study the matter. I have since studied the matter and will now render my ruling. Honourable Members, Standing Order 139 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, provides for the procedure to be followed when raising a Point of Order. In that regard, Standing Order 139 (3) provides as follows: \\u201cIn raising a Point of Order, a Member shall cite the Standing Order, law on privilege of Members, rule of procedure or practice, which has been allegedly breached.\\u201d Honourable Members, a review of the verbatim record of the proceedings of Tuesday, 12th November, 2024, reveals that Honourable M Haimbe, MP in raising his Point of Order did not cite the Standing Order, rule, law on privileges or practice on which his Point of Order was based. In that regard, the Point of Order did not comply with the requirements of Standing Order 139 (3) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024. The Point of Order is, therefore, inadmissible. Honourable Members, I have on several occasions provided guidance to the House on the need to cite the relevant rule, law, privilege, practice or procedure that has been breached, whenever a Point of Order is raised. On that basis, Honourable Members are once more reminded to acquaint themselves with the Standing Orders so as to ensure that whenever a Point of Order is raised, the relevant rule, law, privilege, practice or procedure that has been breached is cited. Therefore, failure to cite the relevant rule, law, privilege, practice or procedure that has been breached whenever a Point of Order is raised shall render such Point of Order inadmissible. Honourable Members, despite the foregoing, a further review of the verbatim record and video footage of the proceedings of the day reveals that Mr Munir Zulu, MP, used the vernacular word \\u201cba mbuli\\u201d twice whilst pointing at Members of Parliament on my right, while debating. I note that the context within which Mr Munir Zulu, MP, used the vernacular remark is derogatory. In that regard, I direct the Director (Hansard) to expunge the words used by Mr Munir Zulu, MP, from the Daily Parliamentary Debates of Tuesday, 12th November, 2024. I THANK YOU.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"context\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"point of order\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"categories\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"disciplinary actions, procedural rulings\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"standingOrder\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"223, 243\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ruling_title_text_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 57,\n        \"min\": 255,\n        \"max\": 336,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          255\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ruling_title_word_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 47,\n        \"max\": 53,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          47\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The Point of Order was premised on Standing Order 203 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2021, which provides for the conduct of members.\\nIn his Point of Order, Mr R K Chitotela, MP, stated that at the beginning of the sitting, when the Hon Madam First Deputy Speaker had suspended business, Mr B Kambita, Member of Parliament for Zambezi East Constituency, walked from his seat, stood at the centre and used unparliamentary language towards him and other senior Members of Parliament. Mr R K Chitotela, MP, further stated that Mr B Kambita, MP, referred to the said Members as \\u201clumpens\\u201d, which he found very provocative. He, therefore, inquired why Mr B Kambita, MP, should not be disciplined for referring to Hon Members of Parliament as \\u201clumpens\\u201d.\\nHon Members, in her immediate response, the Madam First Deputy Speaker reserved her ruling to study the matter. I have since studied the matter and will now render my ruling.\\nHon Members, I had recourse to the verbatim record of the proceedings of the relevant day and note that the Point of Order relates to a period when I had suspended the Business of the House for about ten (10) minutes to restore order and decorum in the House. This was as a result of the disorder occasioned by Mr J E Banda, Member of Parliament for Petauke Central Constituency, and his failure to heed to my directive to leave the House.\\nHon Members, our Standing Orders are instructive on the issue of points of order. A Point of Order is defined as an assertion made by a Member that a rule of procedure or privilege of the House has been breached. Further, Standing Order 139 (7) provides as follows:\\n\\u201c139\\u2026\\n(6) A Point of Order shall only be raised in relation to the conduct of business of the House being transacted at the time the Point of Order is raised.\\u201d\\nAdditionally, Audrey O Brien and Marc Bosc in their book entitled House of Commons, Procedure and Practice, Second Edition, (Quebec, Thomson Reuters, 2009), define a point of order in the following terms at page 632: \\u201cA Point of Order is an intervention by a member who believes that the rules or customary procedures of the House have been incorrectly applied or overlooked during the proceedings. Members may rise on Points of Order to bring the attention of the Chair any breach of the relevance or repetition rule, unparliamentary remarks or lack of quorum.\\u201d\\nHon Members, based on the authorities cited above, it is clear that a Point of Order must be raised on the Floor of the House in respect of an alleged breach of the rules of procedure or privilege. Further, the Point of Order must be in relation to business being transacted at the time it is raised. Therefore, for alleged breaches that occur outside the House, the same can be brought to my attention using other avenues such as through a letter of complaint.\\nHon Members, in the current matter, Mr R K Chitotela, MP, alleged that Mr B Kambita, MP, used unparliamentary and demeaning language towards him and other Members during the period when Business of the House was suspended. Therefore, in line with the above authorities, the Point of Order is inadmissible.\\nI THANK YOU.\",\n          \"Hon Members, the House will recall that on Friday, 6th October, 2023, when the House was considering Question for Oral Answer No 79, and Hon P C C Kabuswe, Minister of Mines and Minerals Development, was on the Floor, Hon B M Mundubile, the then Leader of the Opposition raised a Point of Order. The Point of Order was premised on Standing Order 65 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2021. In his Point of Order, Hon B M Mundubile, MP, asked whether the Hon Minister was in order to insinuate that the Members of Parliament who had laid a report on the Table on Sensele mine were actually laying falsehoods on the Floor of the House. In her immediate response, the Hon Madam First Deputy Speaker reserved her ruling to enable her study the matter. I have since studied the matter, and will now render my ruling. Hon Members, while the House was considering Question for Oral Answer No 79, and Hon P C C Kabuswe, MP, was responding to a question posed by Mr S Kampyongo, Member of Parliament for Shiwangandu Constituency, he stated that people had been lying, through the media, that there were 15,000 illegal miners at Sensele Mine which was not the correct position. The Hon Minister further stated that had there been 15,000 people at KCM, illegally mining, they would have been seen because that was a substantial number. Following the Hon Minister\\u2019s response, Hon B M Mundubile, MP, raised a Point of Order. In raising the Point of Order, he referred to the Report of the Planning and Budgeting Committee on the Effects of Illicit Financial Flows on the Budget and its Sustainability, which was Tabled in the House on 5th June, 2023. The report had revealed that there was a well syndicated and mechanised illegal mining operation at KCM, which the Government had not stopped. It was against this background that Hon B M Mundubile, MP, raised his Point of Order. Hon Members, the Point of order raised by Hon B M Mundubile, MP, raises the issue of a Member providing information to the House that is factual and verifiable while debating. Hon Members, Standing Order 65 (1) (b) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2021, provides as follows: \\u201c(1) A member who is debating shall \\u2013 \\u2026\\n(b) ensure that the information he or she provides to the House is factual and verifiable.\\u201d\\nHon Members, in studying this matter, I had occasion to read the verbatim record of the proceedings for the day. It is clear that the Hon Minister, in his response to Mr S Kampyongo, MP\\u2019s question, informed the House that people had been lying through the media that there were 15,000 illegal miners at Sensele Mine. He further went on to state that had there been 15,000 people illegally mining, they would have been seen because that was a substantial number. However, the Minister went on to state that Government was bringing systems into place to help curb illegal mining but, in the interim, the Zambia Police Service had been brought in to curb illegal mining all over the country. Hon Members, I also had occasion to review the Report of the Planning and Budgeting Committee on the Effects of Illicit Financial Flows on the Budget and its Sustainability. The Committee, at pages 21 and 30 of the Report, observed that there was rampant encroachment of KCM\\u2019s mine and highly syndicated illegal mining. However, the Report did not state the exact number of illegal miners that were at KCM. Hon Members, the Hon Minister in his response to Mr Kampyongo, MP\\u2019s question did not seek to rebut what was contained in the Report of the Planning and Budgeting Committee. Instead, the Hon Minister referred to what was reported in the media, in particular, the quantum of illegal miners at KCM. I, therefore, find that by going further to state that the Zambia Police Service had been engaged to help curb illegal mining all over the country, the Hon Minister admitted that there was illegal mining at various mines in the country. Further, the Hon Minister was also stating the Government\\u2019s position on the matter and rebutting what was reported in the media on the exact number of illegal miners at KCM. The Hon Minister did not at any point state that the Planning and Budgeting Committee had laid falsehoods on the Floor of the House. In that regard, he was not out of order.\\nI thank you.\\nRuling Date: Friday, November 17, 2023\",\n          \"Hon Members I have a ruling to render against Mr M Zulu, Member of Parliament for Lumezi Constituency, who was found in breach of parliamentary privilege and in contempt of the House, on a Point of Order raised by Mr M Jamba, MP and a Complaint by Mr F C Chaatila, MP. As per our practice and procedure, a member who is found in breach of parliamentary privilege and contempt of the House, is required to be present in the House when the ruling is delivered. In that regard, Mr M Zulu, MP, was contacted by the Office of the Clerk to remind him to be present in the House, today, Friday, 7th October, 2022. However, Mr M Zulu, MP, elected to absent himself from the House. I will nonetheless proceed to render the ruling. Hon Members, the House will recall that on Wednesday, 5th October, 2022, when the House was considering the Motion to Abolish the Position of District Commissioner moved by Mr M Zulu, Member of Parliament for Lumezi Constituency, and Mr M Zulu, MP, was winding up debate, Mr M Jamba, Member of Parliament for Mwembeshi Constituency, raised a Point of Order. In his Point of Order, Mr M Jamba, MP, stated that the words uttered by Mr M Zulu, MP, when he was winding up debate on the Motion, were unpalatable and asked how the Hon Mr Second Deputy Speaker could allow him to utter such words.\\nIn his immediate response to the Point of Order, the Hon Mr Second Deputy Speaker reserved his ruling to enable him study the matter. Further, on 6th October, 2022, my Office received a letter of complaint from Mr F C Chaatila, Member of Parliament for Moomba Constituency, on the same matter. In his complaint Mr F C Chaatila, MP, stated that on Wednesday, 5th October, 2022, Mr M Zulu, MP used unprintable and unparliamentary language when he was winding up his debate on the Motion to Abolish the Office of District Commissioner. He added that the use of unparliamentary language is not only contrary to the decorum and dignity of the House, but also prohibited under Standing Order 66 (2) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2021. He, therefore, sought my indulgence on the matter. I have since reviewed the verbatim record of the proceedings for that day as well as the letter of complaint and will now render my ruling.\\nI wish to begin by addressing Mr M Jamba, MP\\u2019s, Point of Order. Hon Members, a review of the verbatim record revealed that Mr M Jamba, MP, in raising his Point of Order, did not cite the relevant Standing Order that had been breached by Mr M Zulu, MP, in his debate as required by Standing Order 131 (3). On that basis, the Point of Order is not admissible. With regard to Mr C F Chaatila\\u2019s complaint, in line with parliamentary practice and procedure, and in accordance with the rules of natural justice, on 6th October, 2022, the Office of the Clerk wrote to Mr M Zulu, MP, requesting him to state his side of the story. In response, Mr M Zulu, MP, confirmed uttering the statement. He added that he had used the statement to metaphysically demonstrate that everyone in the House was an adult. Hon Members, the complaint by Mr F C Chaatila, MP, raises the issue of a Member using insulting language in the House. Hon Members, our rules on parliamentary etiquette prohibit the use of unparliamentary language in the House. To this effect, Standing Order 66 (1) states as follows:\\n\\u201cunparliamentary language refers to the use of offensive, provocative, insulting, threatening or obscene language in the House.\\u201d Hon Members, a review of the verbatim record shows that Mr M Zulu, MP, in winding up the debate on the motion to Abolish the Position of District Commissioner, used unparliamentary language as alleged in the complaint.\\nHon Members, the rules of the House on etiquette and decorum, including the Standing Order that prohibits the use of unparliamentary language, were formulated to maintain discipline, decorum and the dignity of the House. Therefore, Hon Members are called upon to, at all times, refrain from the use of obscene, unpalatable and generally unparliamentary language in their debates in the House.\\nHon Members my predecessors have ruled several Members out of order, for using insulting language in the House. While unparliamentary language does not usually attract a stiff punishment, the language used by the Hon Member for Lumezi Constituency was extremely obscene, inappropriate and demeaning to hon Members of Parliament. Such conduct is totally unacceptable and should not be trivialised. Additionally, hon Members will recall that this is not the first time Mr M Zulu, MP, is committing a serious breach of the rules of the House. In March, 2022, the Committee on Privileges and Absences found him in breach of parliamentary privileges and in contempt of the House for making a statement that reflected negatively on a fellow Member of Parliament. Thus, on 23rd March, 2022, Mr M Zulu, MP, was directed to apologise to the House. Whilst rendering the apology to the House, Mr M Zulu, MP, misconducted himself. This matter too was referred to the Committee on Privileges and Absences for consideration. The Committee, once again, found him guilty of misconduct. As a result he was suspended for a period of ten (10) days. Hon Members, all this shows that the Hon Member is unrepentant and wants to bring this August House into odium, ridicule and disrepute. Hon Members, taking into account the gravity of the offence committed by Mr M Zulu, MP, and in view of the fact that Mr M Zulu, MP, is a repeat offender, I have, in exercise of my powers under section 28 (2) of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, decided to suspend Mr M Zulu, MP, from the service of the National Assembly for a period of thirty (30) days.\\nThus, in accordance with section 28 (2) of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, which requires a resolution of the House to suspend a Member from the House, I now put the Question: The Question is, that the House accordingly suspends Mr M Zulu, MP, for a period of thirty (30) days.\\nAs many as are of that opinion say \\u2018Aye\\u2019;\\nOf the contrary say \\u2018No\\u2019; I think the \\u2018Ayes\\u2019 have it. The House resolves accordingly.\\nHon Members, although Mr M Zulu, MP, is not present in the House, I will proceed to address him in absentia. Let me inform you that the House is extremely displeased with your conduct of using obscene, insulting and demeaning language on the Floor of the House. As an Honourable Member of Parliament, you are expected to conduct yourself with utmost dignity. This is a House of honour, decorum and dignity and I am duty bound to ensure that the honour, decorum and dignity of the House is protected and preserved at all times. I wish to reiterate that I will not tolerate gross indiscipline, and misconduct from you or any other Member.\\nFinally, I wish to inform you that in accordance with section 28 (3) of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, during the period of your suspension, you shall not:\\n(1) enter the precincts of the Assembly and this extends to the National Assembly Motel;\\n(2) participate in any business or activity of the House or a committee to which you are assigned, in your capacity as a Member of the National Assembly; and (3) be paid a salary or allowance that you are entitled to as a Member.\\nI now order, Mr M Zulu, MP, to proceed on thirty (30) days suspension with effect from, today, Friday 7th October to Saturday 5th November, 2022, as resolved by the House.\\nI further direct the Chief Hansard Editor to expunge the obscene words used by Mr M Zulu, MP, from the Daily Parliamentary Debates of Thursday, 5th October, 2022.\\nI thank you.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"context\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"point of order\",\n          \"guidance\",\n          \"complaint\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"categories\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"constitutional interpretations, disciplinary actions, procedural rulings\",\n          \"constitutional interpretations, procedural rulings\",\n          \"procedural rulings\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"standingOrder\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 63,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"19,25,28\",\n          \"85, 86, 27\",\n          \"202, 203, 207\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ruling_title_text_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 114,\n        \"min\": 122,\n        \"max\": 794,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 116,\n        \"samples\": [\n          159,\n          490,\n          408\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ruling_title_word_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 17,\n        \"min\": 25,\n        \"max\": 134,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 57,\n        \"samples\": [\n          70,\n          134,\n          69\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The Point of Order was premised on Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution of Zambia, Chapter 1 of the Laws of Zambia, which provides for the vacation of Office as a Member of Parliament where a Member acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct.\\nIn his Point of Order, Dr C Andeleki, MP, stated that Mr J E Banda, Member of Parliament for Petauke Central Constituency, disappeared from Chipata Central Hospital on Thursday, 20th June, 2024, following his charge for Aggravated Robbery and Attempted Murder. In this regard, Dr C Andeleki, MP, enquired whether Mr J E Banda, MP, was still a Member of Parliament within the definition of section 2 of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, Chapter 12 of the Laws of Zambia, given that he had not appeared in the House since 20th June, 2024.\\nThe Hon Madam First Deputy Speaker rendered a ruling on Tuesday 5th November, 2024, wherein she referred the matter to Committee on Privileges and Absences for determination and for the Committee to make appropriate recommendations by Friday, 15th November, 2024.

Additionally, on Monday, 11th November, 2024, the Office of the Clerk wrote to Dr C Andeleki, MP, to ask him what he knows about Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, absence. However, Mr J E Banda, MP, was not written to since his whereabouts were unknown.\\nThe responses from the witnesses are summarised below.\\n(i) DR C ANDELEKI, MP\\nDr C Andeleki, MP, in his letter of response dated 12th November, 2024, indicated that he was aware that Mr J E Banda, MP, was arrested on 20th June, 2024, for the offence of Aggravated Robbery and Attempted Murder. He stated that in August, 2024, Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, informed the country of the escape of Mr J E Banda, MP, from Chipata Central Hospital where he was receiving medical attention. He further indicated that since his disappearance, Mr J E Banda, MP, had not attended sittings of the House contrary to Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024. Lastly, he pointed out that the continued absence of Mr J E Banda, MP, was a breach of the code of conduct for Members, as such, a vacancy had occurred as per the provisions of Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution.\\n(ii) HON S MULUSA, MP\\nIn his response letter dated Tuesday, 12th November, 2024, Hon S Mulusa, MP, Government Chief Whip, stated that Mr J E Banda, MP, did not seek permission from his office for his absence. He also indicated that he did not know Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, whereabouts.\\n(iii) HON J J MWIIMBU, MP\\nIn a status report dated 11th November, 2024, Hon JJ Mwiimbu, MP, explained that on Sunday, 30th June, 2024, Mr J E Banda, MP, was arrested by the Zambia Police Service for an alleged aggravated robbery dating back to 14th December 2015, in Vubwi District. He indicated that Mr J E Banda, MP, was subsequently committed to the High Court for trial on 19th July, 2024, by the Chipata Magistrate Court and remanded at Namuseche Correctional Facility. He added that on Thursday, 1st August, 2024, Mr J E Banda, MP, fell ill and was taken to Chipata Central Hospital for treatment. Subsequently, three (3) correctional Service Officers and two (2) Zambia Police Officers were assigned to guard him. However, on Sunday, 4th August, 2024, between 21:00 and 22:00 hours, Mr J E Banda, MP, escaped through a hospital window despite being under a five (5) officer guard team. Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, explained that this occurred when Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s wife, requested privacy for him to undergo a routine treatment for his ailment. Further, he stated that investigations were ongoing to determine his whereabouts, including a manhunt, witness interviews, and an internal review of the officers' actions during the escape.\\nHon Members, Dr C Andeleki, MP's, Point of Order raises the issue of vacation of Office as a Member of Parliament where a Member acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct.\\nHon Members, Article 77(1) of the Constitution confers on the National Assembly, the power to regulate its own procedure and make Standing Orders for the conduct of its business. It states as follows:\\n\\u201c(1) Subject to this Article, and Article 78, the National Assembly shall regulate its own procedure and make Standing Orders for the conduct of its business.\\u201d\\nAdditionally, Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution provides as follows:\\n\\u201c(2) The Office of a Member becomes vacant if the member-\\n(a) \\u2026\\n(b) \\u2026\\n(c) acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct.\\u201d\\nFurther, Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, requires Members to seek permission to be absent and provides as follows:\\n\\u201c243. Permission to be Absent (1) A Member seeking to be absent from a Sitting of the House shall seek written permission of the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker in such form as the Speaker may determine, stating the period of absence, the reasons and any other relevant information.\\n(2) The Government Chief Whip shall keep custody of requests for permission and may not disclose the information to third parties without the written consent of the Speaker.\\u201d\\nIn addition, Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, on a Member\\u2019s failure to attend sittings provides that- \\u201c223. (1) If, during a Session, a Member is absent for four or more consecutive Sittings of the Assembly without permission, in writing, from the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker, the matter shall stand referred to the Committee on Privileges and Absences for hearing and determination.\\n(2) If the committee finds that the Member has offered a satisfactory explanation for the Member's absence from Sittings of the Assembly, there shall be no further proceedings on the matter.\\n(3) If the committee finds that the Member has not offered a satisfactory explanation for the member's absence from Sittings of the Assembly, the committee shall, through the Speaker, report to the House recommending appropriate action to be taken against the member.\\u201d\\nFurthermore, eminent authors on parliamentary practice and procedure, M N Kaul and S L Shakdher, in their book entitled Practice and Procedure of Parliament, Seventh Edition, (New Delhi, Lok Sabha, 2016) on page 425, have this to say:\\n\\u201cEach constituency expects that the member it elects will take his seat in the Lok Sabha and attend the sittings of the House, except when it is necessary for him to remain absent on account of unavoidable reasons. It is the right of the Lok Sabha to receive from him an account as to why he was absent. The duty of members to the House is paramount and they are expected to remain absent from the sittings thereof only when there are compelling reasons for doing so.\\u201d From the above authorities, it is evident that a Parliamentary seat is rendered vacant when a Member acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct. In casu, the prescribed code of conduct alleged to have been breached is Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, on a Member's requirement to seek permission from the relevant authorities.\\nHon Members, the Committee met on Wednesday, 13th November, 2024, to deliberate on this matter. Three witnesses, Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, Mr S Mulusa, MP, Government Chief Whip, and Dr C Andeleki, MP, appeared before the Committee to make oral submissions. Their submissions are as set out below.\\n(i) DR C ANDELEKI, MP\\nDr C Andeleki, MP, relied on his written submission. In summary, he stated that Mr J E Banda, MP, had been absent from the sittings of the House since 20th June, 2024, prompting him to raise a Point of Order. He indicated that Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, continued absence breached Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, and was deemed to have vacated his seat under Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution.\\n(ii) HON S MULUSA, MP\\nHon S Mulusa, MP, reiterated that Mr J E Banda, MP, did not seek permission from his office for his absence. He added that he was not in receipt of information on Mr J E Banda, MP, from his proxy or family member, as such, he did not know Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, whereabouts. When asked why his Office did not deal with the matter expeditiously, Hon S Mulusa, MP, stated that the matter involving Mr J E Banda, MP, was criminal in nature and that he was under lawful custody until his escape. In this regard, his Office could not intervene.\\n(iii) HON J J MWIIMBU, MP\\nHon J J Mwiimbu, MP, reiterated what he stated in his written submission. However, he expressed hope of locating Mr J E Banda, MP, in due course. Hon Members, in its deliberations, the Committee noted that if Mr J E Banda, MP, was found to have been absent without permission, the Committee could not impose penalties under Standing Order 223 (4) of the National Assembly Standing Orders, 2024, due to his unknown whereabouts and inability to appear before it. Therefore, in dealing with this matter, the Committee observed that it had the following recommendation options:\\n(i) for the Office of the Speaker to instruct the Attorney-General to commence legal action in the Constitutional Court to have the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat declared vacant for breach of a prescribed code of conduct as provided under Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution of Zambia, Chapter 1 of the Laws of Zambia; or\\n(ii) for the Member to be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failure to which the Hon Madam Speaker should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat.\\nHon Members, after considering the written and oral submissions from the witnesses, the Committee observed as follows:\\n(i) that Mr J E Banda, MP, had been absent without permission since 4th August, 2024;\\n(ii) that his absence without permission breached the prescribed code of conduct, that is, Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024;\\n(iii) that the Petauke Central constituents had been unrepresented since June, 2024, thus, it was in the constituents\\u2019 best interest to have representation in the Assembly; (iv) that due to Mr J E Banda, MP's unknown whereabouts, pursuing legal action through the Attorney-General was impractical as the rules of natural justice would not be attained; and\\n(v) that in line with the rules of natural justice, it was important for Mr J E Banda, MP, to be accorded an opportunity to attend the sittings of the House, failure to which the Hon Madam Speaker should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution.\\nIn view of the foregoing, and in line with parliamentary practice and procedure, and in accordance with the rules of natural justice, the Committee unanimously resolved to recommend that Mr J E Banda, MP, be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failing which my Office should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat. Hon Members, I have considered the recommendations of the Committee. I note, however, that there is no legal requirement for the House to pass a resolution to endorse the recommendations of the Committee. Nonetheless, due to the peculiar circumstances and gravity of this matter, there is need for this House to pass a resolution on the course of action to be taken against Mr J E Banda, MP.\\nI now put the Question: The Question is, that Mr J E Banda, MP, be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failing which my Office should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat. As many as are of that opinion say \\u2018Aye\\u2019;\\n(Pause)\\nOf the contrary say \\u2018No\\u2019;\\nSCENARIO 1\\nI think the \\u2018Ayes\\u2019 have it. [Pause]. The \\u2018Ayes\\u2019 have it. The question is resolved in the affirmative.\\nI will now proceed to address Mr J E Banda, MP, in absentia. Mr J E Banda, MP, you have seven (7) days from today, Tuesday, 19th November, 2024, to Tuesday, 26th November, 2024, within which to attend the business of the House. Should you fail to attend the business of the House within this period, I shall in line with Article 72 (8) of the Constitution proceed to inform the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat.\\nSCENARIO 2\\nI think the \\u2018Noes\\u2019 have it. [pause]. The \\u2018Noes\\u2019 have it. The question is negatived.\",\n          \"Honourable Members, the House will recall that on Tuesday, 15th October, 2024, when the House was considering Question for Oral Answer No.31 and Honourable C Mulenga, MP, Minister of Commerce Trade and Industry had just finished responding to a follow up question by Mr A C Mumba, Member of Parliament for Kantanshi Constituency, Dr C Andeleki, Member of Parliament for Katombola Constituency, raised a Point of Order. The Point of Order was premised on Article 72 (2) (b) and (c) of the Constitution of Zambia, Chapter 1 of the Laws of Zambia, which provides for the vacation of Office as a Member of Parliament where a Member is serving a sentence of imprisonment or acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct.\\nIn his Point of Order, Dr C Andeleki, MP, explained that Mr J E Banda, Member of Parliament for Petauke Central Constituency, disappeared from Chipata Central Hospital on Thursday, 20th June, 2024, following his charge for Aggravated Robbery and Attempted Murder. In this regard, \\nDr C Andeleki, MP, enquired whether Mr J E Banda, MP, was still a Member of Parliament within the definition of Section 2 of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, Chapter 12 of the Laws of Zambia, given that he has not appeared in the House since 20th June, 2024.\\nAdditionally, Dr C Andeleki, MP, stated that Mr R K Chitotela, Member of Parliament for Pambashe Constituency had not appeared in the House since his conviction on Monday, 22nd July, 2024. Further, that Mr N Chilangwa, Member of Parliament for Kawambwa Constituency, had also not appeared in the House following his sentencing on the same day. He, therefore, enquired whether Mr R K Chitotela, MP, and Mr N Chilangwa, MP, were still Members of Parliament within the definition of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act.\\nIn my immediate response, I reserved my ruling to enable me study the matter and deliver a measured ruling. I have since studied the matter and will now render my ruling.\\nHonourable Members, I will first address the status of Mr J E Banda, MP. Thereafter, I will proceed to address the status of Mr R K Chitotela, MP and Mr N Chilangwa, MP.\\n1. THE STATUS OF MR J E BANDA, MP\\nHonourable Members, I wish to begin by giving a background to what gave rise to Dr C Andeleki, MP\\u2019s Point of Order. On Thursday, 20th June, 2024, the Zambia Police Service informed the general public of the formal arrest of Mr J E Banda, MP. Mr J E Banda, MP, was formally charged and arrested on two (2) charges being aggravated robbery and attempted murder and was subsequently transferred to Chipata in the Eastern Province. On Monday, 5th August, 2024, the nation was informed by the Honourable Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security of Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s escape from lawful custody while receiving medical attention at the Chipata General Hospital.\\nHonourable Members, Article 77(1) of the Constitution confers on the National Assembly the power to regulate its own procedure and make Standing Orders for the conduct of its business. In this vein, Standing Order 223 (1) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, on a Member\\u2019s failure to attend sittings provides that-\\n\\u201c223. (1) If, during a Session, a Member is absent for four or more consecutive Sittings of the Assembly without permission, in writing, from the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker, the matter shall stand referred to the Committee on Privileges and Absences for hearing and determination.\\u201d\\nHonourable Members, it is evident that following Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s arrest and detention, the reason for the Member\\u2019s absence from the House was known. However, from the date of his escape from lawful custody, there is no valid reason for his continued absence from the House. In that regard, based on Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia, Standing Orders, 2024, the matter stands referred to the Committee on Privileges and Absences for determination. The Committee shall make appropriate recommendations by Tuesday, 12th November, 2024.\\n2. THE STATUS OF MR R K CHITOTELA, MP, AND MR N CHILANGWA, MP\\nHonourable Members, the background to this matter is that on Monday 22nd July, 2024, the Subordinate Court of the First Class for the Kawambwa District presided over by Honourable Martin Namushi delivered judgment in the matter of The People v Ronald Kaoma Chitotela, Nickson Chilangwa, and Six (6) Others Cause No 1/124/SG/2021. In the judgment, the court found Mr N Chilangwa, MP, guilty of Malicious Damage to Property contrary to section 335 of the Penal Code, Chapter 87 of the Laws of Zambia, and sentenced him to five (5) years imprisonment with hard labour. The Court further found Mr R K Chitotela, MP, guilty of Arson and committed him to the High Court for sentencing. \\nIt is against this background that Dr C Andeleki, MP, raised his Point of Order. \\nHonourable Members, Standing Order 140 (3) of the National Assembly of Zambia, Standing Orders, 2024, on the admissibility of Points of Order provides that-\\n\\u201cA Member shall not reopen a Point of Order, which has already been decided.\\u201d\\nHonourable Members, on Wednesday, 24th July, 2024, Mr M Anakoka, Member of Parliament for Luena Constituency, raised a Point of Order concerning the status of Mr R K Chitotela, MP, and Mr N Chilangwa, MP, after their conviction and sentencing, respectively. A ruling on the effect of the judgement of the subordinate court and the status of the two (2) Members was delivered on the Floor of the House by the Honourable Madam Speaker on Wednesday, 24th July, 2024.\\nHonourable Members, as highlighted above, Standing Order 140 (3) prohibits a Member from reopening a Point of Order which has already been decided. A ruling on the status of Mr R K Chitotela, MP and Mr N Chilangwa, MP, was already delivered.\\nI, therefore, hold that the Point of Order by Dr C Andeleki, MP, on the status of Mr R K Chitotela, MP and Mr N Chilangwa, MP, is inadmissible as it seeks to reopen a matter that was already decided upon. \\n \\nI THANK YOU.\",\n          \"Honourable Members, the House will recall that on Wednesday, 16th October, 2024, when the House was considering Question for Oral Answer No 34, and Honourable M Chikote, MP, Minister of Energy, had just concluded responding to a supplementary question by Mr K Kabaso, Member of Parliament for Mwansabombwe Constituency, Dr C Andeleki, Member of Parliament for Katombola Parliamentary Constituency, raised a Point of Order.\\nIn raising his Point of Order, Dr C Andeleki, MP, explained that on 27th June, 2024, the Constitutional Court dismissed the petition of Mr R K Chitotela, MP, Mr N Chilangwa, MP, Mr Mpakata Musonda, MP, Mr C C Kang\\u2019ombe, MP, Mr R C Mutale, MP, Mr B M Mundubile, MP, Mr S Kampyongo, MP, Mr M Fube, MP and Mr M L Kafwaya, MP, Members of Parliament for Pambashe, Kawambwa, Lupososhi, Kamfinsa, Chitambo, Mporokoso, Shiwang\\u2019andu, Chilubi and Lunte Constituencies, respectively, on account that it lacked jurisdiction on the matter. He added that the Constitutional Court stated that the Petitioners did not raise any Constitutional matter requiring interpretation, as the matter was one relating to the political party to which they belonged. As a result, the Petition of the nine (9) Honourable Members, who were expelled from the PF by their Secretary-General, Mr Morgan Ng\\u2019ona, failed.\\nDr C Andeleki, MP, further added that on Wednesday, 3rd July, 2024, the Honourable Mr Second Deputy Speaker delivered a ruling announcing that vacancies had occurred in the nine (9) constituencies of the Honourable Members, following a Point of Order raised by the Honourable Minister of Information and Media against the nine (9) PF Members.\\nDr C Andeleki, MP, also asserted that on Tuesday, 15th October 2024, the Constitutional Court ruled on the matter between the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) and Belemu Sibanze. The Court held that once the election process is triggered by a vacancy, it must run its course until the election, with no extension provided for in the Constitution. He further contended that, in light of this judgment, the seats of the nine (9) Honourable Members had become vacant.\\nDr C Andeleki,MP, therefore, enquired whether the nine (9) PF Members were in order to remain in the House and participate in its business given the holding of the Constitutional Court and in light of their expulsion from the PF. Honourable Members, in her immediate response, the Hon Madam First Deputy Speaker reserved her ruling in order to study the matter. I have since studied the matter and will now render my ruling.\\nHonourable Members, before delving into the merits of this Point of Order, I wish to address the issue relating to its admissibility. Honourable Members, Standing Order 139 (3) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, requires a Member who wishes to raise a Point of Order to cite the Standing Order, law on privilege of Members, rule of procedure or practice that has been allegedly breached. In addition, Standing Order 139 (4) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, provides that where a Member does not cite the Standing Order, law on privileges of Members, rule of procedure or practice breached, the presiding officer may insist on him or her doing so, and if he or she fails or does not adequately do so, the presiding officer may rule that the Point of Order is inadmissible.\\nHonourable Members, a review of the verbatim record of the proceedings of Wednesday, 16th October, 2024, reveals that Dr C Andeleki, MP, did not cite the Standing Order, law on privilege of Members, rule of procedure or practice on which his Point of Order was based. Therefore, Standing Order 139(4) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, would ordinarily require me to rule the Point of Order inadmissible. However, given the significance of the issues raised, I will proceed to render my ruling. Honourable Members, Dr C Andeleki, MP\\u2019s Point of Order raises issues of whether Members of Parliament who have lost their seats can continue to remain in the House and participate in its business.\\nHonourable Members, Article 72 (8) of the Constitution of Zambia, Chapter 1 of the Laws of Zambia, obliges me to inform the Electoral Commission of Zambia of any vacancy in the National Assembly within seven (7) days of its occurrence. In accordance with this mandate, I promptly notified the Electoral Commission of Zambia following the ruling delivered by the Honourable Mr Second Deputy Speaker on 3rd July 2024, which announced the vacancies in nine (9) constituencies.\\nHonourable Members, in light of the announcement made on 3rd July 2024, by the Honourable Mr Second Deputy Speaker regarding the vacancies that had occurred in nine constituencies, the nine (9) affected Members commenced judicial review proceedings in the High Court challenging that decision. On Wednesday, 23rd October, 2024, the High Court declared that the decision by the Honourable Mr Second Deputy Speaker was ultra vires and consequently quashed it. Further, Honourable Members, I wish to add that the nine (9) Members of Parliament have challenged their expulsion by Mr M B Sampa, Member of Parliament for Matero Constituency in the High Court under cause No.2024/HP/1056. Therefore, I cannot delve into the merits of the Point of Order as the matter is sub-Judice\\nI THANK YOU.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"merged_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Ruling by Hon Madam Speaker - On a Point of Order raised on Tuesday, 15th October, 2024 by Dr C Andeleki, MP, on the Status of Mr J E Banda, MP for Petauke Central, following his absence from the House after his disappearance from Chipata Central Hospital Hon Members will recall that on Tuesday, 15th October, 2024, Dr C Andeleki, Member of Parliament for Katombola Constituency, raised a Point of Order.

He stated that in August, 2024, Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, informed the country of the escape of Mr J E Banda, MP, from Chipata Central Hospital where he was receiving medical attention.

Lastly, he pointed out that the continued absence of Mr J E Banda, MP, was a breach of the code of conduct for Members, as such, a vacancy had occurred as per the provisions of Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution.\\n(ii) HON S MULUSA, MP\\nIn his response letter dated Tuesday, 12th November, 2024, Hon S Mulusa, MP, Government Chief Whip, stated that Mr J E Banda, MP, did not seek permission from his office for his absence. He also indicated that he did not know Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, whereabouts.\\n(iii) HON J J MWIIMBU, MP\\nIn a status report dated 11th November, 2024, Hon JJ Mwiimbu, MP, explained that on Sunday, 30th June, 2024, Mr J E Banda, MP, was arrested by the Zambia Police Service for an alleged aggravated robbery dating back to 14th December 2015, in Vubwi District. He indicated that Mr J E Banda, MP, was subsequently committed to the High Court for trial on 19th July, 2024, by the Chipata Magistrate Court and remanded at Namuseche Correctional Facility. He added that on Thursday, 1st August, 2024, Mr J E Banda, MP, fell ill and was taken to Chipata Central Hospital for treatment. Subsequently, three (3) correctional Service Officers and two (2) Zambia Police Officers were assigned to guard him. However, on Sunday, 4th August, 2024, between 21:00 and 22:00 hours, Mr J E Banda, MP, escaped through a hospital window despite being under a five (5) officer guard team. Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, explained that this occurred when Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s wife, requested privacy for him to undergo a routine treatment for his ailment. Further, he stated that investigations were ongoing to determine his whereabouts, including a manhunt, witness interviews, and an internal review of the officers' actions during the escape.\\nHon Members, Dr C Andeleki, MP's, Point of Order raises the issue of vacation of Office as a Member of Parliament where a Member acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct.\\nHon Members, Article 77(1) of the Constitution confers on the National Assembly, the power to regulate its own procedure and make Standing Orders for the conduct of its business. It states as follows:\\n\\u201c(1) Subject to this Article, and Article 78, the National Assembly shall regulate its own procedure and make Standing Orders for the conduct of its business.\\u201d\\nAdditionally, Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution provides as follows:\\n\\u201c(2) The Office of a Member becomes vacant if the member-\\n(a) \\u2026\\n(b) \\u2026\\n(c) acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct.\\u201d\\nFurther, Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, requires Members to seek permission to be absent and provides as follows:\\n\\u201c243. Permission to be Absent (1) A Member seeking to be absent from a Sitting of the House shall seek written permission of the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker in such form as the Speaker may determine, stating the period of absence, the reasons and any other relevant information.\\n(2) The Government Chief Whip shall keep custody of requests for permission and may not disclose the information to third parties without the written consent of the Speaker.\\u201d\\nIn addition, Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, on a Member\\u2019s failure to attend sittings provides that- \\u201c223. (1) If, during a Session, a Member is absent for four or more consecutive Sittings of the Assembly without permission, in writing, from the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker, the matter shall stand referred to the Committee on Privileges and Absences for hearing and determination.\\n(2) If the committee finds that the Member has offered a satisfactory explanation for the Member's absence from Sittings of the Assembly, there shall be no further proceedings on the matter.\\n(3) If the committee finds that the Member has not offered a satisfactory explanation for the member's absence from Sittings of the Assembly, the committee shall, through the Speaker, report to the House recommending appropriate action to be taken against the member.\\u201d\\nFurthermore, eminent authors on parliamentary practice and procedure, M N Kaul and S L Shakdher, in their book entitled Practice and Procedure of Parliament, Seventh Edition, (New Delhi, Lok Sabha, 2016) on page 425, have this to say:\\n\\u201cEach constituency expects that the member it elects will take his seat in the Lok Sabha and attend the sittings of the House, except when it is necessary for him to remain absent on account of unavoidable reasons. It is the right of the Lok Sabha to receive from him an account as to why he was absent. The duty of members to the House is paramount and they are expected to remain absent from the sittings thereof only when there are compelling reasons for doing so.\\u201d From the above authorities, it is evident that a Parliamentary seat is rendered vacant when a Member acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct. In casu, the prescribed code of conduct alleged to have been breached is Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, on a Member's requirement to seek permission from the relevant authorities.\\nHon Members, the Committee met on Wednesday, 13th November, 2024, to deliberate on this matter. Three witnesses, Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, Mr S Mulusa, MP, Government Chief Whip, and Dr C Andeleki, MP, appeared before the Committee to make oral submissions. Their submissions are as set out below.\\n(i) DR C ANDELEKI, MP\\nDr C Andeleki, MP, relied on his written submission. In summary, he stated that Mr J E Banda, MP, had been absent from the sittings of the House since 20th June, 2024, prompting him to raise a Point of Order. He indicated that Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, continued absence breached Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, and was deemed to have vacated his seat under Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution.\\n(ii) HON S MULUSA, MP\\nHon S Mulusa, MP, reiterated that Mr J E Banda, MP, did not seek permission from his office for his absence. He added that he was not in receipt of information on Mr J E Banda, MP, from his proxy or family member, as such, he did not know Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, whereabouts. When asked why his Office did not deal with the matter expeditiously, Hon S Mulusa, MP, stated that the matter involving Mr J E Banda, MP, was criminal in nature and that he was under lawful custody until his escape. In this regard, his Office could not intervene.\\n(iii) HON J J MWIIMBU, MP\\nHon J J Mwiimbu, MP, reiterated what he stated in his written submission. However, he expressed hope of locating Mr J E Banda, MP, in due course. Hon Members, in its deliberations, the Committee noted that if Mr J E Banda, MP, was found to have been absent without permission, the Committee could not impose penalties under Standing Order 223 (4) of the National Assembly Standing Orders, 2024, due to his unknown whereabouts and inability to appear before it. Therefore, in dealing with this matter, the Committee observed that it had the following recommendation options:\\n(i) for the Office of the Speaker to instruct the Attorney-General to commence legal action in the Constitutional Court to have the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat declared vacant for breach of a prescribed code of conduct as provided under Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution of Zambia, Chapter 1 of the Laws of Zambia; or\\n(ii) for the Member to be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failure to which the Hon Madam Speaker should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat.\\nHon Members, after considering the written and oral submissions from the witnesses, the Committee observed as follows:\\n(i) that Mr J E Banda, MP, had been absent without permission since 4th August, 2024;\\n(ii) that his absence without permission breached the prescribed code of conduct, that is, Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024;\\n(iii) that the Petauke Central constituents had been unrepresented since June, 2024, thus, it was in the constituents\\u2019 best interest to have representation in the Assembly; (iv) that due to Mr J E Banda, MP's unknown whereabouts, pursuing legal action through the Attorney-General was impractical as the rules of natural justice would not be attained; and\\n(v) that in line with the rules of natural justice, it was important for Mr J E Banda, MP, to be accorded an opportunity to attend the sittings of the House, failure to which the Hon Madam Speaker should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution.\\nIn view of the foregoing, and in line with parliamentary practice and procedure, and in accordance with the rules of natural justice, the Committee unanimously resolved to recommend that Mr J E Banda, MP, be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failing which my Office should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat. Hon Members, I have considered the recommendations of the Committee. I note, however, that there is no legal requirement for the House to pass a resolution to endorse the recommendations of the Committee. Nonetheless, due to the peculiar circumstances and gravity of this matter, there is need for this House to pass a resolution on the course of action to be taken against Mr J E Banda, MP.\\nI now put the Question: The Question is, that Mr J E Banda, MP, be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failing which my Office should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat. As many as are of that opinion say \\u2018Aye\\u2019;\\n(Pause)\\nOf the contrary say \\u2018No\\u2019;\\nSCENARIO 1\\nI think the \\u2018Ayes\\u2019 have it. [Pause]. The \\u2018Ayes\\u2019 have it. The question is resolved in the affirmative.\\nI will now proceed to address Mr J E Banda, MP, in absentia. Mr J E Banda, MP, you have seven (7) days from today, Tuesday, 19th November, 2024, to Tuesday, 26th November, 2024, within which to attend the business of the House. Should you fail to attend the business of the House within this period, I shall in line with Article 72 (8) of the Constitution proceed to inform the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat.\\nSCENARIO 2\\nI think the \\u2018Noes\\u2019 have it. [pause]. The \\u2018Noes\\u2019 have it. The question is negatived.\",\n          \"RULING BY THE HONOURABLE MADAM FIRST DEPUTY SPEAKER ON A POINT OF ORDER RAISED ON TUESDAY, 15TH OCTOBER, 2024, BY DR C ANDELEKI, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR KATOMBOLA CONSTITUENCY ON THE STATUS OF MR J E BANDA, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR PETAUKE CENTRAL CONSTITUENCY, FOLLOWING HIS ABSENCE FROM THE HOUSE AFTER HIS DISAPPEARANCE FROM CHIPATA CENTRAL HOSPITAL AND ON THE STATUS OF MR R K CHITOTELA, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR PAMBASHE CONSTITUENCY FOLLOWING HIS CONVICTION AND MR N CHILANGWA MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR KAWAMBWA CONSTITUENCY FOLLOWING HIS SENTENCING Honourable Members, the House will recall that on Tuesday, 15th October, 2024, when the House was considering Question for Oral Answer No.31 and Honourable C Mulenga, MP, Minister of Commerce Trade and Industry had just finished responding to a follow up question by Mr A C Mumba, Member of Parliament for Kantanshi Constituency, Dr C Andeleki, Member of Parliament for Katombola Constituency, raised a Point of Order. The Point of Order was premised on Article 72 (2) (b) and (c) of the Constitution of Zambia, Chapter 1 of the Laws of Zambia, which provides for the vacation of Office as a Member of Parliament where a Member is serving a sentence of imprisonment or acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct.\\nIn his Point of Order, Dr C Andeleki, MP, explained that Mr J E Banda, Member of Parliament for Petauke Central Constituency, disappeared from Chipata Central Hospital on Thursday, 20th June, 2024, following his charge for Aggravated Robbery and Attempted Murder. In this regard, \\nDr C Andeleki, MP, enquired whether Mr J E Banda, MP, was still a Member of Parliament within the definition of Section 2 of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, Chapter 12 of the Laws of Zambia, given that he has not appeared in the House since 20th June, 2024.\\nAdditionally, Dr C Andeleki, MP, stated that Mr R K Chitotela, Member of Parliament for Pambashe Constituency had not appeared in the House since his conviction on Monday, 22nd July, 2024. Further, that Mr N Chilangwa, Member of Parliament for Kawambwa Constituency, had also not appeared in the House following his sentencing on the same day. He, therefore, enquired whether Mr R K Chitotela, MP, and Mr N Chilangwa, MP, were still Members of Parliament within the definition of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act.\\nIn my immediate response, I reserved my ruling to enable me study the matter and deliver a measured ruling. I have since studied the matter and will now render my ruling.\\nHonourable Members, I will first address the status of Mr J E Banda, MP. Thereafter, I will proceed to address the status of Mr R K Chitotela, MP and Mr N Chilangwa, MP.\\n1. THE STATUS OF MR J E BANDA, MP\\nHonourable Members, I wish to begin by giving a background to what gave rise to Dr C Andeleki, MP\\u2019s Point of Order. On Thursday, 20th June, 2024, the Zambia Police Service informed the general public of the formal arrest of Mr J E Banda, MP. Mr J E Banda, MP, was formally charged and arrested on two (2) charges being aggravated robbery and attempted murder and was subsequently transferred to Chipata in the Eastern Province. On Monday, 5th August, 2024, the nation was informed by the Honourable Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security of Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s escape from lawful custody while receiving medical attention at the Chipata General Hospital.\\nHonourable Members, Article 77(1) of the Constitution confers on the National Assembly the power to regulate its own procedure and make Standing Orders for the conduct of its business. In this vein, Standing Order 223 (1) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, on a Member\\u2019s failure to attend sittings provides that-\\n\\u201c223. (1) If, during a Session, a Member is absent for four or more consecutive Sittings of the Assembly without permission, in writing, from the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker, the matter shall stand referred to the Committee on Privileges and Absences for hearing and determination.\\u201d\\nHonourable Members, it is evident that following Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s arrest and detention, the reason for the Member\\u2019s absence from the House was known. However, from the date of his escape from lawful custody, there is no valid reason for his continued absence from the House. In that regard, based on Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia, Standing Orders, 2024, the matter stands referred to the Committee on Privileges and Absences for determination. The Committee shall make appropriate recommendations by Tuesday, 12th November, 2024.\\n2. THE STATUS OF MR R K CHITOTELA, MP, AND MR N CHILANGWA, MP\\nHonourable Members, the background to this matter is that on Monday 22nd July, 2024, the Subordinate Court of the First Class for the Kawambwa District presided over by Honourable Martin Namushi delivered judgment in the matter of The People v Ronald Kaoma Chitotela, Nickson Chilangwa, and Six (6) Others Cause No 1/124/SG/2021. In the judgment, the court found Mr N Chilangwa, MP, guilty of Malicious Damage to Property contrary to section 335 of the Penal Code, Chapter 87 of the Laws of Zambia, and sentenced him to five (5) years imprisonment with hard labour. The Court further found Mr R K Chitotela, MP, guilty of Arson and committed him to the High Court for sentencing. \\nIt is against this background that Dr C Andeleki, MP, raised his Point of Order. \\nHonourable Members, Standing Order 140 (3) of the National Assembly of Zambia, Standing Orders, 2024, on the admissibility of Points of Order provides that-\\n\\u201cA Member shall not reopen a Point of Order, which has already been decided.\\u201d\\nHonourable Members, on Wednesday, 24th July, 2024, Mr M Anakoka, Member of Parliament for Luena Constituency, raised a Point of Order concerning the status of Mr R K Chitotela, MP, and Mr N Chilangwa, MP, after their conviction and sentencing, respectively. A ruling on the effect of the judgement of the subordinate court and the status of the two (2) Members was delivered on the Floor of the House by the Honourable Madam Speaker on Wednesday, 24th July, 2024.\\nHonourable Members, as highlighted above, Standing Order 140 (3) prohibits a Member from reopening a Point of Order which has already been decided. A ruling on the status of Mr R K Chitotela, MP and Mr N Chilangwa, MP, was already delivered.\\nI, therefore, hold that the Point of Order by Dr C Andeleki, MP, on the status of Mr R K Chitotela, MP and Mr N Chilangwa, MP, is inadmissible as it seeks to reopen a matter that was already decided upon. \\n \\nI THANK YOU.\",\n          \"RULING BY THE HONOURABLE MADAM SPEAKER ON A POINT OF ORDER RAISED ON WEDNESDAY, 16TH OCTOBER, 2024, BY DR C ANDELEKI, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR KATOMBOLA CONSTITUENCY, AGAINST THE NINE (9) EXPELLED PATRIOTIC FRONT PARTY (PF) MEMBERS FOR THEIR CONTINUED STAY IN THE HOUSE DESPITE THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT JUDGMENT RENDERED ON 15TH OCTOBER, 2024 Honourable Members, the House will recall that on Wednesday, 16th October, 2024, when the House was considering Question for Oral Answer No 34, and Honourable M Chikote, MP, Minister of Energy, had just concluded responding to a supplementary question by Mr K Kabaso, Member of Parliament for Mwansabombwe Constituency, Dr C Andeleki, Member of Parliament for Katombola Parliamentary Constituency, raised a Point of Order.\\nIn raising his Point of Order, Dr C Andeleki, MP, explained that on 27th June, 2024, the Constitutional Court dismissed the petition of Mr R K Chitotela, MP, Mr N Chilangwa, MP, Mr Mpakata Musonda, MP, Mr C C Kang\\u2019ombe, MP, Mr R C Mutale, MP, Mr B M Mundubile, MP, Mr S Kampyongo, MP, Mr M Fube, MP and Mr M L Kafwaya, MP, Members of Parliament for Pambashe, Kawambwa, Lupososhi, Kamfinsa, Chitambo, Mporokoso, Shiwang\\u2019andu, Chilubi and Lunte Constituencies, respectively, on account that it lacked jurisdiction on the matter. He added that the Constitutional Court stated that the Petitioners did not raise any Constitutional matter requiring interpretation, as the matter was one relating to the political party to which they belonged. As a result, the Petition of the nine (9) Honourable Members, who were expelled from the PF by their Secretary-General, Mr Morgan Ng\\u2019ona, failed.\\nDr C Andeleki, MP, further added that on Wednesday, 3rd July, 2024, the Honourable Mr Second Deputy Speaker delivered a ruling announcing that vacancies had occurred in the nine (9) constituencies of the Honourable Members, following a Point of Order raised by the Honourable Minister of Information and Media against the nine (9) PF Members.\\nDr C Andeleki, MP, also asserted that on Tuesday, 15th October 2024, the Constitutional Court ruled on the matter between the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) and Belemu Sibanze. The Court held that once the election process is triggered by a vacancy, it must run its course until the election, with no extension provided for in the Constitution. He further contended that, in light of this judgment, the seats of the nine (9) Honourable Members had become vacant.\\nDr C Andeleki,MP, therefore, enquired whether the nine (9) PF Members were in order to remain in the House and participate in its business given the holding of the Constitutional Court and in light of their expulsion from the PF. Honourable Members, in her immediate response, the Hon Madam First Deputy Speaker reserved her ruling in order to study the matter. I have since studied the matter and will now render my ruling.\\nHonourable Members, before delving into the merits of this Point of Order, I wish to address the issue relating to its admissibility. Honourable Members, Standing Order 139 (3) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, requires a Member who wishes to raise a Point of Order to cite the Standing Order, law on privilege of Members, rule of procedure or practice that has been allegedly breached. In addition, Standing Order 139 (4) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, provides that where a Member does not cite the Standing Order, law on privileges of Members, rule of procedure or practice breached, the presiding officer may insist on him or her doing so, and if he or she fails or does not adequately do so, the presiding officer may rule that the Point of Order is inadmissible.\\nHonourable Members, a review of the verbatim record of the proceedings of Wednesday, 16th October, 2024, reveals that Dr C Andeleki, MP, did not cite the Standing Order, law on privilege of Members, rule of procedure or practice on which his Point of Order was based. Therefore, Standing Order 139(4) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, would ordinarily require me to rule the Point of Order inadmissible. However, given the significance of the issues raised, I will proceed to render my ruling. Honourable Members, Dr C Andeleki, MP\\u2019s Point of Order raises issues of whether Members of Parliament who have lost their seats can continue to remain in the House and participate in its business.\\nHonourable Members, Article 72 (8) of the Constitution of Zambia, Chapter 1 of the Laws of Zambia, obliges me to inform the Electoral Commission of Zambia of any vacancy in the National Assembly within seven (7) days of its occurrence. In accordance with this mandate, I promptly notified the Electoral Commission of Zambia following the ruling delivered by the Honourable Mr Second Deputy Speaker on 3rd July 2024, which announced the vacancies in nine (9) constituencies.\\nHonourable Members, in light of the announcement made on 3rd July 2024, by the Honourable Mr Second Deputy Speaker regarding the vacancies that had occurred in nine constituencies, the nine (9) affected Members commenced judicial review proceedings in the High Court challenging that decision. On Wednesday, 23rd October, 2024, the High Court declared that the decision by the Honourable Mr Second Deputy Speaker was ultra vires and consequently quashed it. Further, Honourable Members, I wish to add that the nine (9) Members of Parliament have challenged their expulsion by Mr M B Sampa, Member of Parliament for Matero Constituency in the High Court under cause No.2024/HP/1056. Therefore, I cannot delve into the merits of the Point of Order as the matter is sub-Judice\\nI THANK YOU.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Additionally, on Monday, 11th November, 2024, the Office of the Clerk wrote to Dr C Andeleki, MP, to ask him what he knows about Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, absence. However, Mr J E Banda, MP, was not written to since his whereabouts were unknown.\\nThe responses from the witnesses are summarised below.\\n(i) DR C ANDELEKI, MP\\nDr C Andeleki, MP, in his letter of response dated 12th November, 2024, indicated that he was aware that Mr J E Banda, MP, was arrested on 20th June, 2024, for the offence of Aggravated Robbery and Attempted Murder. He stated that in August, 2024, Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, informed the country of the escape of Mr J E Banda, MP, from Chipata Central Hospital where he was receiving medical attention. He further indicated that since his disappearance, Mr J E Banda, MP, had not attended sittings of the House contrary to Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024. Lastly, he pointed out that the continued absence of Mr J E Banda, MP, was a breach of the code of conduct for Members, as such, a vacancy had occurred as per the provisions of Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution.\\n(ii) HON S MULUSA, MP\\nIn his response letter dated Tuesday, 12th November, 2024, Hon S Mulusa, MP, Government Chief Whip, stated that Mr J E Banda, MP, did not seek permission from his office for his absence.

He indicated that Mr J E Banda, MP, was subsequently committed to the High Court for trial on 19th July, 2024, by the Chipata Magistrate Court and remanded at Namuseche Correctional Facility. He added that on Thursday, 1st August, 2024, Mr J E Banda, MP, fell ill and was taken to Chipata Central Hospital for treatment. Subsequently, three (3) correctional Service Officers and two (2) Zambia Police Officers were assigned to guard him. However, on Sunday, 4th August, 2024, between 21:00 and 22:00 hours, Mr J E Banda, MP, escaped through a hospital window despite being under a five (5) officer guard team. Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, explained that this occurred when Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s wife, requested privacy for him to undergo a routine treatment for his ailment. Further, he stated that investigations were ongoing to determine his whereabouts, including a manhunt, witness interviews, and an internal review of the officers' actions during the escape.\\nHon Members, Dr C Andeleki, MP's, Point of Order raises the issue of vacation of Office as a Member of Parliament where a Member acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct.\\nHon Members, Article 77(1) of the Constitution confers on the National Assembly, the power to regulate its own procedure and make Standing Orders for the conduct of its business. It states as follows:\\n\\u201c(1) Subject to this Article, and Article 78, the National Assembly shall regulate its own procedure and make Standing Orders for the conduct of its business.\\u201d\\nAdditionally, Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution provides as follows:\\n\\u201c(2) The Office of a Member becomes vacant if the member-\\n(a) \\u2026\\n(b) \\u2026\\n(c) acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct.\\u201d\\nFurther, Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, requires Members to seek permission to be absent and provides as follows:\\n\\u201c243. Permission to be Absent (1) A Member seeking to be absent from a Sitting of the House shall seek written permission of the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker in such form as the Speaker may determine, stating the period of absence, the reasons and any other relevant information.\\n(2) The Government Chief Whip shall keep custody of requests for permission and may not disclose the information to third parties without the written consent of the Speaker.\\u201d\\nIn addition, Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, on a Member\\u2019s failure to attend sittings provides that- \\u201c223. (1) If, during a Session, a Member is absent for four or more consecutive Sittings of the Assembly without permission, in writing, from the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker, the matter shall stand referred to the Committee on Privileges and Absences for hearing and determination.\\n(2) If the committee finds that the Member has offered a satisfactory explanation for the Member's absence from Sittings of the Assembly, there shall be no further proceedings on the matter.\\n(3) If the committee finds that the Member has not offered a satisfactory explanation for the member's absence from Sittings of the Assembly, the committee shall, through the Speaker, report to the House recommending appropriate action to be taken against the member.\\u201d\\nFurthermore, eminent authors on parliamentary practice and procedure, M N Kaul and S L Shakdher, in their book entitled Practice and Procedure of Parliament, Seventh Edition, (New Delhi, Lok Sabha, 2016) on page 425, have this to say:\\n\\u201cEach constituency expects that the member it elects will take his seat in the Lok Sabha and attend the sittings of the House, except when it is necessary for him to remain absent on account of unavoidable reasons. It is the right of the Lok Sabha to receive from him an account as to why he was absent. The duty of members to the House is paramount and they are expected to remain absent from the sittings thereof only when there are compelling reasons for doing so.\\u201d From the above authorities, it is evident that a Parliamentary seat is rendered vacant when a Member acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct. In casu, the prescribed code of conduct alleged to have been breached is Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, on a Member's requirement to seek permission from the relevant authorities.\\nHon Members, the Committee met on Wednesday, 13th November, 2024, to deliberate on this matter. Three witnesses, Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, Mr S Mulusa, MP, Government Chief Whip, and Dr C Andeleki, MP, appeared before the Committee to make oral submissions. Their submissions are as set out below.\\n(i) DR C ANDELEKI, MP\\nDr C Andeleki, MP, relied on his written submission. In summary, he stated that Mr J E Banda, MP, had been absent from the sittings of the House since 20th June, 2024, prompting him to raise a Point of Order. He indicated that Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, continued absence breached Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, and was deemed to have vacated his seat under Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution.\\n(ii) HON S MULUSA, MP\\nHon S Mulusa, MP, reiterated that Mr J E Banda, MP, did not seek permission from his office for his absence. He added that he was not in receipt of information on Mr J E Banda, MP, from his proxy or family member, as such, he did not know Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, whereabouts. When asked why his Office did not deal with the matter expeditiously, Hon S Mulusa, MP, stated that the matter involving Mr J E Banda, MP, was criminal in nature and that he was under lawful custody until his escape. In this regard, his Office could not intervene.\\n(iii) HON J J MWIIMBU, MP\\nHon J J Mwiimbu, MP, reiterated what he stated in his written submission. However, he expressed hope of locating Mr J E Banda, MP, in due course. Hon Members, in its deliberations, the Committee noted that if Mr J E Banda, MP, was found to have been absent without permission, the Committee could not impose penalties under Standing Order 223 (4) of the National Assembly Standing Orders, 2024, due to his unknown whereabouts and inability to appear before it. Therefore, in dealing with this matter, the Committee observed that it had the following recommendation options:\\n(i) for the Office of the Speaker to instruct the Attorney-General to commence legal action in the Constitutional Court to have the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat declared vacant for breach of a prescribed code of conduct as provided under Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution of Zambia, Chapter 1 of the Laws of Zambia; or\\n(ii) for the Member to be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failure to which the Hon Madam Speaker should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat.\\nHon Members, after considering the written and oral submissions from the witnesses, the Committee observed as follows:\\n(i) that Mr J E Banda, MP, had been absent without permission since 4th August, 2024;\\n(ii) that his absence without permission breached the prescribed code of conduct, that is, Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024;\\n(iii) that the Petauke Central constituents had been unrepresented since June, 2024, thus, it was in the constituents\\u2019 best interest to have representation in the Assembly; (iv) that due to Mr J E Banda, MP's unknown whereabouts, pursuing legal action through the Attorney-General was impractical as the rules of natural justice would not be attained; and\\n(v) that in line with the rules of natural justice, it was important for Mr J E Banda, MP, to be accorded an opportunity to attend the sittings of the House, failure to which the Hon Madam Speaker should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution.\\nIn view of the foregoing, and in line with parliamentary practice and procedure, and in accordance with the rules of natural justice, the Committee unanimously resolved to recommend that Mr J E Banda, MP, be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failing which my Office should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat. Hon Members, I have considered the recommendations of the Committee. I note, however, that there is no legal requirement for the House to pass a resolution to endorse the recommendations of the Committee. Nonetheless, due to the peculiar circumstances and gravity of this matter, there is need for this House to pass a resolution on the course of action to be taken against Mr J E Banda, MP.\\nI now put the Question: The Question is, that Mr J E Banda, MP, be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failing which my Office should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat. As many as are of that opinion say \\u2018Aye\\u2019;\\n(Pause)\\nOf the contrary say \\u2018No\\u2019;\\nSCENARIO 1\\nI think the \\u2018Ayes\\u2019 have it. [Pause]. The \\u2018Ayes\\u2019 have it. The question is resolved in the affirmative.\\nI will now proceed to address Mr J E Banda, MP, in absentia. Mr J E Banda, MP, you have seven (7) days from today, Tuesday, 19th November, 2024, to Tuesday, 26th November, 2024, within which to attend the business of the House. Should you fail to attend the business of the House within this period, I shall in line with Article 72 (8) of the Constitution proceed to inform the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat.\\nSCENARIO 2\\nI think the \\u2018Noes\\u2019 have it. [pause]. The \\u2018Noes\\u2019 have it. The question is negatived.\",\n          \"Honourable Members will recall that on Tuesday, 12th November, 2024, when the House was considering the Report of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Human Rights and Governance on the Accession of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Aiming at the Abolition of the Death Penalty and Mr H Mapani, Member of Parliament for Namwala Constituency was debating, Honourable M Haimbe, MP, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, raised a Point of Order. In his Point of Order, Honourable M Haimbe, MP, inquired whether Mr Munir Zulu, Member of Parliament for Lumezi Constituency, was in order to use a derogatory term whilst pointing at Members of Parliament on the right side of the Speaker, while debating. Honourable Members, in her immediate response, the Honourable Madam First Deputy Speaker reserved her ruling in order to study the matter. I have since studied the matter and will now render my ruling. Honourable Members, Standing Order 139 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, provides for the procedure to be followed when raising a Point of Order. In that regard, Standing Order 139 (3) provides as follows: \\u201cIn raising a Point of Order, a Member shall cite the Standing Order, law on privilege of Members, rule of procedure or practice, which has been allegedly breached.\\u201d Honourable Members, a review of the verbatim record of the proceedings of Tuesday, 12th November, 2024, reveals that Honourable M Haimbe, MP in raising his Point of Order did not cite the Standing Order, rule, law on privileges or practice on which his Point of Order was based. In that regard, the Point of Order did not comply with the requirements of Standing Order 139 (3) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024. The Point of Order is, therefore, inadmissible. Honourable Members, I have on several occasions provided guidance to the House on the need to cite the relevant rule, law, privilege, practice or procedure that has been breached, whenever a Point of Order is raised. On that basis, Honourable Members are once more reminded to acquaint themselves with the Standing Orders so as to ensure that whenever a Point of Order is raised, the relevant rule, law, privilege, practice or procedure that has been breached is cited. Therefore, failure to cite the relevant rule, law, privilege, practice or procedure that has been breached whenever a Point of Order is raised shall render such Point of Order inadmissible. Honourable Members, despite the foregoing, a further review of the verbatim record and video footage of the proceedings of the day reveals that Mr Munir Zulu, MP, used the vernacular word \\u201cba mbuli\\u201d twice whilst pointing at Members of Parliament on my right, while debating. I note that the context within which Mr Munir Zulu, MP, used the vernacular remark is derogatory. In that regard, I direct the Director (Hansard) to expunge the words used by Mr Munir Zulu, MP, from the Daily Parliamentary Debates of Tuesday, 12th November, 2024.

He added that he was not in receipt of information on Mr J E Banda, MP, from his proxy or family member, as such, he did not know Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, whereabouts. When asked why his Office did not deal with the matter expeditiously, Hon S Mulusa, MP, stated that the matter involving Mr J E Banda, MP, was criminal in nature and that he was under lawful custody until his escape. In this regard, his Office could not intervene.\\n(iii) HON J J MWIIMBU, MP\\nHon J J Mwiimbu, MP, reiterated what he stated in his written submission. However, he expressed hope of locating Mr J E Banda, MP, in due course. Hon Members, in its deliberations, the Committee noted that if Mr J E Banda, MP, was found to have been absent without permission, the Committee could not impose penalties under Standing Order 223 (4) of the National Assembly Standing Orders, 2024, due to his unknown whereabouts and inability to appear before it. Therefore, in dealing with this matter, the Committee observed that it had the following recommendation options:\\n(i) for the Office of the Speaker to instruct the Attorney-General to commence legal action in the Constitutional Court to have the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat declared vacant for breach of a prescribed code of conduct as provided under Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution of Zambia, Chapter 1 of the Laws of Zambia; or\\n(ii) for the Member to be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failure to which the Hon Madam Speaker should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat.\\nHon Members, after considering the written and oral submissions from the witnesses, the Committee observed as follows:\\n(i) that Mr J E Banda, MP, had been absent without permission since 4th August, 2024;\\n(ii) that his absence without permission breached the prescribed code of conduct, that is, Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024;\\n(iii) that the Petauke Central constituents had been unrepresented since June, 2024, thus, it was in the constituents\\u2019 best interest to have representation in the Assembly; (iv) that due to Mr J E Banda, MP's unknown whereabouts, pursuing legal action through the Attorney-General was impractical as the rules of natural justice would not be attained; and\\n(v) that in line with the rules of natural justice, it was important for Mr J E Banda, MP, to be accorded an opportunity to attend the sittings of the House, failure to which the Hon Madam Speaker should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution.\\nIn view of the foregoing, and in line with parliamentary practice and procedure, and in accordance with the rules of natural justice, the Committee unanimously resolved to recommend that Mr J E Banda, MP, be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failing which my Office should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat. Hon Members, I have considered the recommendations of the Committee. I note, however, that there is no legal requirement for the House to pass a resolution to endorse the recommendations of the Committee. Nonetheless, due to the peculiar circumstances and gravity of this matter, there is need for this House to pass a resolution on the course of action to be taken against Mr J E Banda, MP.\\nI now put the Question: The Question is, that Mr J E Banda, MP, be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failing which my Office should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat. As many as are of that opinion say \\u2018Aye\\u2019;\\n(Pause)\\nOf the contrary say \\u2018No\\u2019;\\nSCENARIO 1\\nI think the \\u2018Ayes\\u2019 have it. [Pause]. The \\u2018Ayes\\u2019 have it. The question is resolved in the affirmative.\\nI will now proceed to address Mr J E Banda, MP, in absentia. Mr J E Banda, MP, you have seven (7) days from today, Tuesday, 19th November, 2024, to Tuesday, 26th November, 2024, within which to attend the business of the House. Should you fail to attend the business of the House within this period, I shall in line with Article 72 (8) of the Constitution proceed to inform the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat.\\nSCENARIO 2\\nI think the \\u2018Noes\\u2019 have it. [pause]. The \\u2018Noes\\u2019 have it. The question is negatived.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I have studied the matter and will now render my ruling.\\nI wish to begin by guiding the House that a Point of Order cannot be raised against the House. This is because the purpose of a Point of Order is to draw the Speaker\\u2019s attention to a breach of the rules of the House by a Member. In this regard, the Point of Order was flawed and ordinarily I would not have entertained it.\\nHowever, since it raises a novel issue, I have decided to seize this opportunity to give the House some guidance on the matter raised in the Point of Order.\\nHon Members, as you are well aware, it is prohibited for any person to wear or display any form of political party regalia on the precincts of Parliament. This is because the precincts of Parliament are not a place for political party activities or campaigns, but are a place where the people\\u2019s representatives converge to conduct the affairs of the entire nation. Further, allowing party regalia in the House can potentially result in unnecessary political conflict that will divert the attention of the House from serious business that it requires to transact.\\nHaving said that, I wish to state that wearing attire, whose colour is associated with a political party, but which does not bear any political party symbol or reference to that party does not amount to wearing party regalia. Hon Members, I carefully examined the photo that displays on the screen whenever Mr G G Nkombo, MP, speaks through his microphone. My examination revealed that while the shirt, indeed, appears to be in the United Party for National Development\\u2019s (UPND) signature colour; red, it does not bear any party symbol or indeed any reference to the UPND. In this regard, it is admissible. I, however, noted that the attire Hon G G Nkombo wore in the photo was quite informal. While there is no rule barring this, I wish to urge Hon Members to, as far as possible, submit photos that conform to the official dress code provided in Standing Order 165 whenever they are submitting photos for official use.\\nThat is my ruling.\\nI thank you.\\nRuling Date: Thursday, March 15, 2018\\nParliamentary Period: Second Session of the Twelfth Assembly\",\n          \"Hon Members will recall that on Tuesday, 3rd October, 2017, when the House was considering Question for Oral Answer No. 41 and the Hon Member of Parliament for Bweengwa Parliamentary Constituency, Mr K Michelo, MP, was asking a follow-up Question, Hon J Kapata, MP, Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, raised a Point of Order alleging that Dr C Kambwili, MP, had accused her of stealing money through the sale of Mukula tree and had been calling her a thief on radio stations and in other print and electronic media.\\nIn my immediate remarks, I reserved my ruling on the matter. I later referred the matter to the Committee on Privileges, Absences and Support Services for consideration.\\nThe Committee on Privileges, Absences and Support Services met to consider the matter. In line with parliamentary practice and procedure, and in accordance with the rules of natural justice, both the Hon Minister and Dr C Kambwili, MP, appeared before the Committee to make their oral submissions on the matter.\\nIn submitting to the Committee, the Hon Minister re-stated her complaint as contained in the Point of Order; that is, she referred to the alleged utterances of Dr Kambwili, MP, reported in the print and electronic media where he alleged that Hon Kapata, MP, was a thief. She asked the Committee to request Dr Kambwili, MP, to provide evidence that she was a thief and demanded for an apology from Dr Kambwili, MP.\\nFurther, Hon Kapata, MP, informed the Committee that she was in the process of commencing legal proceedings against Dr Kambwili, MP, over the matter. In that regard, she submitted that her lawyers had since written to Dr Kambwili, MP, requesting him to retract his defamatory statements against the Hon Minister within seven (7) days. She submitted that since Dr Kambwili, MP, had not responded to the letter, her lawyers would proceed to commence court action against him.\\nOn the other hand, Dr Kambwili, MP, when asked to respond to the Hon Minister\\u2019s complaint, submitted that he would not comment on what he had said on radio stations, as he was not bound to account for what he said outside the House to the House. He added that if Hon Kapata MP was injured by what he had said, she was at liberty to seek redress in the courts of law.\\nThe Committee deliberated on the matter and made the following findings:\\n(i) That the Hon Minister\\u2019s complaint was based on statements allegedly made by Dr Kambwili, MP, against her on radio stations and in other print and electronic media;\\n(ii) That Hon Kapata, MP, was in the process of commencing legal proceedings over the matter against Dr Kambwili, MP; and\\n(iii) That the statements complained of were not made in the House.\\nIn view of these findings, the Committee was in agreement that the alleged statements by Dr Kambwili, MP, against Hon Kapata, MP, were made outside the House and in the political arena. Therefore, the committee resolved that it could not dwell on the matter as it fell outside its jurisdiction. The Committee accordingly advised Hon Kapata, MP, to seek other avenues of redress available to her if she so wished. And I uphold the decision of the Committee.\\nI thank you.

The Point of Order was premised on Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution of Zambia, Chapter 1 of the Laws of Zambia, which provides for the vacation of Office as a Member of Parliament where a Member acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct.\\nIn his Point of Order, Dr C Andeleki, MP, stated that Mr J E Banda, Member of Parliament for Petauke Central Constituency, disappeared from Chipata Central Hospital on Thursday, 20th June, 2024, following his charge for Aggravated Robbery and Attempted Murder. In this regard, Dr C Andeleki, MP, enquired whether Mr J E Banda, MP, was still a Member of Parliament within the definition of section 2 of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, Chapter 12 of the Laws of Zambia, given that he had not appeared in the House since 20th June, 2024.\\nThe Hon Madam First Deputy Speaker rendered a ruling on Tuesday 5th November, 2024, wherein she referred the matter to Committee on Privileges and Absences for determination and for the Committee to make appropriate recommendations by Friday, 15th November, 2024. This decision was premised on Standing Order 223 (1) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, on a Member\\u2019s failure to attend sittings which provides that-\\n\\u201c223. (1) If, during a Session, a Member is absent for four or more consecutive Sittings of the Assembly without permission, in writing, from the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker, the matter shall stand referred to the Committee on Privileges and Absences for hearing and determination.\\u201d\\nTherefore, in line with parliamentary practice and procedure, and in accordance with the rules of natural justice, on Wednesday, 6th November, 2024, the Office of the Clerk wrote to Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, and Hon S Mulusa, MP, Government Chief Whip, to state what they know about the absence of Mr J E Banda, MP, since Thursday, 20th June, 2024. Additionally, on Monday, 11th November, 2024, the Office of the Clerk wrote to Dr C Andeleki, MP, to ask him what he knows about Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, absence. However, Mr J E Banda, MP, was not written to since his whereabouts were unknown.\\nThe responses from the witnesses are summarised below.\\n(i) DR C ANDELEKI, MP\\nDr C Andeleki, MP, in his letter of response dated 12th November, 2024, indicated that he was aware that Mr J E Banda, MP, was arrested on 20th June, 2024, for the offence of Aggravated Robbery and Attempted Murder. He stated that in August, 2024, Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, informed the country of the escape of Mr J E Banda, MP, from Chipata Central Hospital where he was receiving medical attention. He further indicated that since his disappearance, Mr J E Banda, MP, had not attended sittings of the House contrary to Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024. Lastly, he pointed out that the continued absence of Mr J E Banda, MP, was a breach of the code of conduct for Members, as such, a vacancy had occurred as per the provisions of Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution.\\n(ii) HON S MULUSA, MP\\nIn his response letter dated Tuesday, 12th November, 2024, Hon S Mulusa, MP, Government Chief Whip, stated that Mr J E Banda, MP, did not seek permission from his office for his absence. He also indicated that he did not know Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, whereabouts.\\n(iii) HON J J MWIIMBU, MP\\nIn a status report dated 11th November, 2024, Hon JJ Mwiimbu, MP, explained that on Sunday, 30th June, 2024, Mr J E Banda, MP, was arrested by the Zambia Police Service for an alleged aggravated robbery dating back to 14th December 2015, in Vubwi District. He indicated that Mr J E Banda, MP, was subsequently committed to the High Court for trial on 19th July, 2024, by the Chipata Magistrate Court and remanded at Namuseche Correctional Facility. He added that on Thursday, 1st August, 2024, Mr J E Banda, MP, fell ill and was taken to Chipata Central Hospital for treatment. Subsequently, three (3) correctional Service Officers and two (2) Zambia Police Officers were assigned to guard him. However, on Sunday, 4th August, 2024, between 21:00 and 22:00 hours, Mr J E Banda, MP, escaped through a hospital window despite being under a five (5) officer guard team. Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, explained that this occurred when Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s wife, requested privacy for him to undergo a routine treatment for his ailment. Further, he stated that investigations were ongoing to determine his whereabouts, including a manhunt, witness interviews, and an internal review of the officers' actions during the escape.\\nHon Members, Dr C Andeleki, MP's, Point of Order raises the issue of vacation of Office as a Member of Parliament where a Member acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct.\\nHon Members, Article 77(1) of the Constitution confers on the National Assembly, the power to regulate its own procedure and make Standing Orders for the conduct of its business. It states as follows:\\n\\u201c(1) Subject to this Article, and Article 78, the National Assembly shall regulate its own procedure and make Standing Orders for the conduct of its business.\\u201d\\nAdditionally, Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution provides as follows:\\n\\u201c(2) The Office of a Member becomes vacant if the member-\\n(a) \\u2026\\n(b) \\u2026\\n(c) acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct.\\u201d\\nFurther, Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, requires Members to seek permission to be absent and provides as follows:\\n\\u201c243. Permission to be Absent (1) A Member seeking to be absent from a Sitting of the House shall seek written permission of the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker in such form as the Speaker may determine, stating the period of absence, the reasons and any other relevant information.\\n(2) The Government Chief Whip shall keep custody of requests for permission and may not disclose the information to third parties without the written consent of the Speaker.\\u201d\\nIn addition, Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, on a Member\\u2019s failure to attend sittings provides that- \\u201c223. (1) If, during a Session, a Member is absent for four or more consecutive Sittings of the Assembly without permission, in writing, from the Government Chief Whip or the Speaker, the matter shall stand referred to the Committee on Privileges and Absences for hearing and determination.\\n(2) If the committee finds that the Member has offered a satisfactory explanation for the Member's absence from Sittings of the Assembly, there shall be no further proceedings on the matter.\\n(3) If the committee finds that the Member has not offered a satisfactory explanation for the member's absence from Sittings of the Assembly, the committee shall, through the Speaker, report to the House recommending appropriate action to be taken against the member.\\u201d\\nFurthermore, eminent authors on parliamentary practice and procedure, M N Kaul and S L Shakdher, in their book entitled Practice and Procedure of Parliament, Seventh Edition, (New Delhi, Lok Sabha, 2016) on page 425, have this to say:\\n\\u201cEach constituency expects that the member it elects will take his seat in the Lok Sabha and attend the sittings of the House, except when it is necessary for him to remain absent on account of unavoidable reasons. It is the right of the Lok Sabha to receive from him an account as to why he was absent. The duty of members to the House is paramount and they are expected to remain absent from the sittings thereof only when there are compelling reasons for doing so.\\u201d From the above authorities, it is evident that a Parliamentary seat is rendered vacant when a Member acts contrary to a prescribed code of conduct. In casu, the prescribed code of conduct alleged to have been breached is Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, on a Member's requirement to seek permission from the relevant authorities.\\nHon Members, the Committee met on Wednesday, 13th November, 2024, to deliberate on this matter. Three witnesses, Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP, Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, Mr S Mulusa, MP, Government Chief Whip, and Dr C Andeleki, MP, appeared before the Committee to make oral submissions. Their submissions are as set out below.\\n(i) DR C ANDELEKI, MP\\nDr C Andeleki, MP, relied on his written submission. In summary, he stated that Mr J E Banda, MP, had been absent from the sittings of the House since 20th June, 2024, prompting him to raise a Point of Order. He indicated that Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, continued absence breached Standing Order 223 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024, and was deemed to have vacated his seat under Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution.\\n(ii) HON S MULUSA, MP\\nHon S Mulusa, MP, reiterated that Mr J E Banda, MP, did not seek permission from his office for his absence. He added that he was not in receipt of information on Mr J E Banda, MP, from his proxy or family member, as such, he did not know Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s, whereabouts. When asked why his Office did not deal with the matter expeditiously, Hon S Mulusa, MP, stated that the matter involving Mr J E Banda, MP, was criminal in nature and that he was under lawful custody until his escape. In this regard, his Office could not intervene.\\n(iii) HON J J MWIIMBU, MP\\nHon J J Mwiimbu, MP, reiterated what he stated in his written submission. However, he expressed hope of locating Mr J E Banda, MP, in due course. Hon Members, in its deliberations, the Committee noted that if Mr J E Banda, MP, was found to have been absent without permission, the Committee could not impose penalties under Standing Order 223 (4) of the National Assembly Standing Orders, 2024, due to his unknown whereabouts and inability to appear before it. Therefore, in dealing with this matter, the Committee observed that it had the following recommendation options:\\n(i) for the Office of the Speaker to instruct the Attorney-General to commence legal action in the Constitutional Court to have the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat declared vacant for breach of a prescribed code of conduct as provided under Article 72 (2) (c) of the Constitution of Zambia, Chapter 1 of the Laws of Zambia; or\\n(ii) for the Member to be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failure to which the Hon Madam Speaker should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat.\\nHon Members, after considering the written and oral submissions from the witnesses, the Committee observed as follows:\\n(i) that Mr J E Banda, MP, had been absent without permission since 4th August, 2024;\\n(ii) that his absence without permission breached the prescribed code of conduct, that is, Standing Order 243 of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2024;\\n(iii) that the Petauke Central constituents had been unrepresented since June, 2024, thus, it was in the constituents\\u2019 best interest to have representation in the Assembly; (iv) that due to Mr J E Banda, MP's unknown whereabouts, pursuing legal action through the Attorney-General was impractical as the rules of natural justice would not be attained; and\\n(v) that in line with the rules of natural justice, it was important for Mr J E Banda, MP, to be accorded an opportunity to attend the sittings of the House, failure to which the Hon Madam Speaker should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution.\\nIn view of the foregoing, and in line with parliamentary practice and procedure, and in accordance with the rules of natural justice, the Committee unanimously resolved to recommend that Mr J E Banda, MP, be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failing which my Office should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat. Hon Members, I have considered the recommendations of the Committee. I note, however, that there is no legal requirement for the House to pass a resolution to endorse the recommendations of the Committee. Nonetheless, due to the peculiar circumstances and gravity of this matter, there is need for this House to pass a resolution on the course of action to be taken against Mr J E Banda, MP.\\nI now put the Question: The Question is, that Mr J E Banda, MP, be given seven (7) days within which to attend the business of the House, failing which my Office should invoke Article 72 (8) of the Constitution by informing the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat. As many as are of that opinion say \\u2018Aye\\u2019;\\n(Pause)\\nOf the contrary say \\u2018No\\u2019;\\nSCENARIO 1\\nI think the \\u2018Ayes\\u2019 have it. [Pause]. The \\u2018Ayes\\u2019 have it. The question is resolved in the affirmative.\\nI will now proceed to address Mr J E Banda, MP, in absentia. Mr J E Banda, MP, you have seven (7) days from today, Tuesday, 19th November, 2024, to Tuesday, 26th November, 2024, within which to attend the business of the House. Should you fail to attend the business of the House within this period, I shall in line with Article 72 (8) of the Constitution proceed to inform the Electoral Commission of Zambia of the occurrence of a vacancy in the Petauke Central Parliamentary seat.\\nSCENARIO 2\\nI think the \\u2018Noes\\u2019 have it. [pause]. The \\u2018Noes\\u2019 have it. The question is negatived.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
