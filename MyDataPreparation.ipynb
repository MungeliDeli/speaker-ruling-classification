Following presentation of the statement, when Mr T J Kasonso, Member of Parliament for Solwezi West Parliamentary Constituency, was about to ask a question, Mr G G Nkombo, Member of Parliament for Mazabuka Central Parliamentary Constituency, raised the following point of order:\\n\\u201cSir, my point of order is procedural and anchored on the precedents of this House.\\nSir, my point of order is on the Hon Minister of Finance. In his question, the Hon Leader of Opposition, Mr Jack Mwiimbu, MP, indicated that the Patriotic Front (PF) is coercing HonMembers of this House, particularly from the opposition where I belong, to vote for the Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) Bill No. 10 of 2019, in order for the delimitation exercise to happen.In his response, the Hon Minister made reference to a stranger in this House. Sir, you have always ruled that things that are said outside of this House have no bearing whatsoever to the business of this House. The Hon Minister made a reference to Mr Stephen Katuka, the Secretary-General for the United Party for National Development (UPND), as having advocated for the increase of constituencies through delimitation. That being the case, is the Hon Minister of Finance in order to marry a straight question on the Order Paper with the pronouncements that are being made outside this House? I seek your ruling, Sir.\\u201d\\nIn my immediate response, I reserved my ruling to study the matter. I have since studied the matter, and will now render my ruling.\\nHon Members, the Point of Order raised by Mr G G Nkombo, MP, raises the issue whether a Member, in debating, can refer to a statement made by a personoutside the Chamber, who is not a Member of Parliament.\\nHon Members, as you are aware, one of the privileges that Members enjoy is freedom of speech, and debate in the House. This freedom is recognised and protected by the Constitution, Chapter 1 of the Laws of Zambia, and the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, Chapter 12 of the Laws of Zambia.\\nIn this regard, Article 76 of the Constitution provides as follows: \\u201c76. (1) A Member of Parliament has freedom of speech and debate in the National Assembly, and that freedom shall not be ousted or questioned in a court or tribunal.\\u201d\\nAdditionally, section 3 of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act is expressed in the following terms:\\n\\u201c3. There shall be freedom of speech and debate in the Assembly. Such freedomof speech and debate shall not be liable to be questioned in any court or place outside theAssembly.\\u201d\\nHon Members, although the Constitution and the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, guarantee freedom of speech and debate in the Assembly, such freedom is subject to the rules of the House.One such ruleis that Membersshould desist from bringing,into their debate,third parties, issues that occur, or statements that are made outside the House. Further, Members are prohibited, in their debate, from directly or indirectly,unfairly criticising, or making offensive, disrespectful, derogatory,disparaging or denigrating remarks against persons outside the House. The reason for this, is that the freedom of expressionallowed to Members,entails that a Member is granted immunity from being sued or impeached or questioned, in a court of law, because any statements made in the course of Parliamentary proceedings are absolutely privileged, thereby leavesan aggrieved person, without legal redress. It is for this reason that Presiding Officers have ruled on many occasions, that Members should steer away from debating people who are not in the House and, have no opportunity to defend or justify themselves.\\nAnother cardinal ruleof the House stipulates that the information a Member provides to the Houseshould be factual, verifiable, and substantiated. In this regard, Standing Order No. 53 (1)of the National of Assembly Standing Orders, 2016 provides as follows:\\n\\u201cA member shall, in debating any matter, ensure that the information he or she provides to the House is factual and verifiable.\\u201d\\nHon Members, I have rendered several rulings on this matter. I, therefore, do not wish to belabour the point, suffice to say that Members may make reference to the cases of Hon S Kampyongo, MP, v Dr C Kambwili, MP (Daily Parliamentary Debate of 21st March, 2018), and Mr G G Nkombo, MP v Hon Dr C Chilufya, MP (Daily Parliamentary Debate of 13th July, 2018).Finally, Members should ensure that the information they provide is relevant to the business before the House.\\nI must state, here, that to proscribe Members frommakingany reference to statements made outside the House,absolutely, and unconditionally, would not only infringe Members freedom of expression and debate in the House, but would also simply be impracticable. Therefore, the benchmark that is employed to ascertain whether or not a Member\\u2019s reference to an outsider or and a statement by an outsider is admissible, iswhether such a statement is relevant, factual and verifiable in relation, to the issues under consideration by the House. And, further,is not offensive, disrespectful, derogating, disparaging, or denigrating of an outsider.\\nI now wish to address the issue or question raised by Mr G G Nkombo, MP, in his Point of Order. That is,whether the Hon Minister of Finance was in order to makereference to the statement by the Secretary-General of the UPND, in his response to the question asked.Hon Members, I wish to inform the House that I had recourse to the Parliamentary Debates of Thursday 15th October, 2020.The relevant excerpt reads as follows:\\n\\u201cMr Mwiimbu: Sir, our colleagues on your right have been luring our colleagues by stating that they will create more constituencies so that there will be more Hon Members in this House which means that there will be more cost to the Government. That is what it means. Now, with those proposals in the Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) Bill No.10 of 2019, does the Hon Minister not think that he will have difficulties convincing our lenders that we are having fiscal problems in the country when they are showing that they have a lot of money? Mr Ng\\u2019andu: Mr Speaker, I thank you. Let me comment on the comment made by the Leader of the Opposition regarding the delimitation exercise. I think we all recall that a few days ago, the Secretary-General of his own party was advocating for the increase in the number of constituencies except that he wanted it to be done outside the Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) Bill No.10 of 2019 context.\\u201d\\nHon Members, from the foregoing, it is evident that the Hon Minister of Finance made reference to astatementby the Secretary-General of UPNDmade outside the House on the delimitation of constituencies. This was done in reference to the issue of the delimitation exercise raised in the question to him by Hon J J Mwiimbu, MP. Therefore, reference to the statement, was relevant to the business before the House. It is further noteworthy that in making reference to the statement, the Hon Minister of Finance did not in any way make a personal attack or disparage the UPND Secretary-General. He merely made reference to a statement that the Secretary-General had made, which was, as a matter of fact, already in the public domain.\\nIn view of the foregoing, my ruling is that the Hon Minister of Finance was not out of order.\\nI thank you.\\nRuling Date: Hon Members will recall that on Thursday15thOctober, 2020, Hon Dr B K E Ng\\u2019andu, MP, Minister of Finance, presented a Ministerial Statement on Zambia\\u2019s Public Debt Management Strategy.

Is the Hon Minister in order to keep quiet whilst people are still waiting for the statement? I seek your serious ruling, Sir.\\u201d\\nHon Members, in my immediate response, I reserved my ruling to enable me peruse the verbatim record of the proceedings on the material day. I have since perused the relevant verbatim record, and will now render my ruling.\\nHon Members, the verbatim record of the proceedings of the House for Tuesday, 6th October, 2020, reveal that the genesis of the Point of Order is the response to Question for Oral Answer No. 42, which was asked by Mr C Chali, MP, to the Minister of Mines and Minerals Development. The relevant part of the question read as follows: \\u201c42. Mr Chali (Nchanga) to ask the Minister of Mines and Minerals Development: (a) what the status of the liquidation process of Konkola Copper Mines was, as of July, 2020;\\u2026\\u201d\\nIn response to this part of the question, Hon R Musukwa, MP, Minister of Mines and Minerals Development, responded as follows: \\u201cMr Speaker, the Government will present a comprehensive statement over the liquidation of Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) at an appropriate time at the instance of the Hon Mr Speaker\\u2019s authority\\u2026\\u201d Hon Members, from the foregoing, it is self evident that the Hon Minister undertook to give a comprehensive report to the House on the status of the liquidation of KCM, at a later date. What is also clear is that the Hon Minister did not indicate the day when he would render the said Ministerial Statement to the House. In view of this, I find that the Minister was not out of order for not having rendered the Ministerial Statement to date. However, given the time lapse since the undertaking was made and in order to expedite the process, I hereby direct the Minister of Mines and Minerals Development to render a comprehensive statement on the status of the liquidation of KCM to the House on Thursday, 26th November, 2020.\",\n          \"RULING BY THE HON MADAM SPEAKER ON THE COMPLAINT BY MR C ANDELEKI, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR KATOMBOLA CONSTITUENCY AGAINST MR J E BANDA, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR PETAUKE CENTRAL CONSTITUENCY FOR STATING THAT HE WAS SUSPENDED FROM THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SO THAT THE STANDING ORDERS COULD BE CHANGED AND MONEY COULD BE STOLEN, IN A VIDEO FOOTAGE THAT HAD BEEN WIDELY CIRCULATED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER MEDIA PLATFORMS. Hon Members I have a ruling to render against Mr J E Banda, Member of Parliament for Petauke Central Constituency.\\nIn line with our practice and procedure, a Member against whom a complaint is raised is required to be present in the House when the ruling is delivered. In that regard, Mr J E Banda, MP, was contacted by the Office of the Clerk to inform him to be present in the House, today, Tuesday, 19th March, 2024. However, Mr J E Banda, MP, elected to absent himself from the House. I will, nonetheless proceed to render the ruling. Hon Members, I wish to inform the House that on Thursday, 30th November, 2023, my office received a letter of complaint from Mr C Andeleki, Member of Parliament for Katombola Constituency, against Mr J E Banda, MP. In his complaint Mr C Andeleki, MP, alleged that Mr J E Banda, MP, made defamatory utterances, in vernacular, in a video footage circulated on social media and other media platforms. Mr C Andeleki, MP, stated that Mr J E Banda, MP, in the video footage made the following statement:\\n\\u201cwe were chased from Parliament to enable them misappropriate funds, additionally they altered the Standing Orders, what will our children find?\\u201d\\nAdditionally, Mr C Andeleki, MP, alleged that Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s statement brought the reputation and dignity of the National Assembly into disrepute. He, therefore, enquired whether Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s conduct did not violate Standing Orders 202 (1), (2) and (3), 203 (1) and (2) and 207 (1), (2)(a) and (3) of the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders, 2021. Hon Members, in line with parliamentary practice and procedure, and in accordance with the rules of natural justice, on 3rd January, 2024, the Office of the Clerk officially wrote to Mr J E Banda, MP, requesting him to state his side of the story on the matter. In response, Mr J E Banda, MP, stated that he had not been availed the footage or link to the said footage for him to appreciate the nature of the complaint and respond effectively. Therefore, the Office of the Clerk availed Mr J E Banda, MP, the video footage via his email and cell phone number using a digital platform called WeTransfer. However, despite sending the video footage to Mr J E Banda, MP, he neglected or refused to respond to the letters sent to him. Hon Members, the complaint by Mr C Andeleki, MP, raises the issue of a Member making a speech reflecting negatively on the House or its Members. Section 19 (e) of the National Assembly Powers and Privileges Act, Chapter 12 of the Laws of Zambia criminalises acts of intentional disrespect to or concerning the proceedings of the Assembly. It states as follows:\\n\\\"19. Any person shall be guilty of an offence who-\\n(a)\\u2026\\n\\u2026(e) commits any other act of intentional disrespect to or with reference to the proceedings of the Assembly or of a committee of the Assembly or to any person presiding at such proceedings.\\\"\\nAdditionally, the National Assembly of Zambia, Standing Orders, 2021, regulates the proceedings of the House. In this regard, Standing order 207 (1), (2) (a) and (b) provides as follows:\\n\\u201c207. (1) Contempt of the House refers to an act, omission or conduct, which obstructs or impedes either the House or members or officer in the discharge of their duties.\\n(2) In addition to instances under section nineteen of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, the following may constitute contempt of the House:\\n(a) a speech or writing reflecting negatively on the House or members\\u2026.\\n(3) Any person who commits contempt of the House shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act.\\u201d\\nFurther, eminent writers on parliamentary practice and procedure, S L Shakdher and M N Kaul in their book entitled Practice and Procedure of Parliament, Seventh Edition (New Delhi, Lok Sabha, 2016) state as follows at page 304:\\n\\u201cIt is a breach of privilege and contempt of the House to make speeches, or to print or publish any libels, reflecting on the character or proceedings of the House or its Committees, or any member of the House or relating to his character or conduct as a Member of Parliament\\u2026.\\nSpeeches and writings reflecting on the House or its Committees or members are punished by the House as contempt on the principle that such acts \\u201ctend to obstruct the Houses in the performance of their functions by diminishing the respect due to them.\\u201d \\u2026 In order to constitute a breach of privilege, however, a libel upon a member of Parliament must concern his character or conduct in his capacity as a member of the House and must be \\u201cbased on matters arising in the actual transaction of the business of the House\\u201d.\\\"\\nThe erstwhile Speaker, Rt Hon Justice Patrick Matibini, SC, had occasion to rule on a similar matter in the case of Hon S Kampyongo, MP, Minister of Home Affairs as he was then v Mr C Mweetwa, Member of Parliament for Choma Central Constituency (Daily Parliamentary Debate of 8th April, 2021). In that matter, Mr C Mweetwa, MP, appeared on Prime Television on a programme called \\u201cOxygen and Democracy\\u201d to discuss the topic \\u201cRule of Law Part 2\\u201d. In his discussion, Mr C Mweetwa, MP, uttered statements which reflected on the Office of the Speaker, and negatively misrepresented the proceedings of the House. Consequently, the Committee on Privileges, Absences and Support Services, as it was then, found that the statement by Mr C Mweetwa, MP reflected on the character and impartiality of the Speaker, and amounted to intentional disrespect to or with reference to the Proceedings of the Assembly. Therefore, Mr C Mweetwa, MP, had acted contrary to the provisions of section 19 (e) of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act and was, in that regard, in breach of parliamentary privilege and in contempt of the House.\\nHon Members, on the recommendation of the Committee, Mr C Mweetwa, MP, was suspended for thirty (30) days, in line with section 28 (2) of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act.\\nFrom the foregoing authorities, it is clear that it is a breach of parliamentary privilege and contempt of the House for a Member to make a speech reflecting negatively on the House or its Members. Hon Members, the matter was referred to the Committee on Privileges and Absences for determination. The Committee on Privileges and Absences met and deliberated on the matter on Wednesday, 6th March 2024. Both the complainant and the respondent appeared before the Committee, and stated their side of the story. Mr C Andeleki, MP, relied on his written complaint and further confirmed that the video footage was indeed the subject of his complaint. In response, Mr J E Banda, MP, confirmed that the video footage was correctly attributed to him. He stated that before recording the video, he had discussed the need to amend the National Assembly of Zambia Standing Orders to downscale Members\\u2019 emoluments with Mr C Andeleki, MP. He explained that they had discussed the issue of the excess funds being allocated to other sectors of the economy as a means of tackling the economic challenges the country was facing. He concluded his submission by stating that he recorded the video to point out the aforementioned issues. Hon Members, in considering the matter, the Committee had recourse to the relevant video footage and the oral submissions by both parties. The Committee found that Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s statement on Facebook, was in breach of parliamentary privileges and contempt of the House.\\nHon Members, the Committee deliberated on the appropriate punishment to mete out to Mr J E Banda, MP. In its deliberations, the Committee took into consideration the following issues:\\n(a) That Mr J E Banda, MP confirmed that the video footage was correctly attributed to him;\\n(b) that although the words complained of were not in the exact order they were stated in the complaint, they were, indeed, uttered by Mr J E Banda, MP; (c) that there was overwhelming evidence to substantiate the allegations against Mr J E Banda, MP;\\n(d) that Mr J E Banda, MP\\u2019s conduct was unbefitting of a Member and brought the House into disrepute;\\n(e) that Mr J E Banda, MP, was not remorseful, he had wasted the Committee\\u2019s time, and was a repeat offender; and\\n(f) that the contempt committed by Mr J E Banda, MP, was of a serious nature.\\nHon Members, after due consideration of the above factors, the Committee resolved to recommend that Mr J E Banda, MP, be suspended from the National Assembly for thirty (30) days, in accordance with section 28 (2) of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, which requires a resolution of the House to suspend a Member from the House. I fully endorse the Committee\\u2019s recommendation.\\nTherefore, in line with the recommendation of the Committee on Privileges and Absences and in accordance with section 28 (2) of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, I now put the Question: The Question is, that the House accordingly suspends Mr J E Banda, MP, for a period of thirty (30) days.\\nAs many as are of that opinion say \\u2018Aye\\u2019;\\n(Pause)\\nOf the contrary say \\u2018No\\u2019;\\nSCENARIO 1\\nI think the \\u2018Ayes\\u2019 have it. [Pause]. The \\u2018Ayes\\u2019 have it. The question is resolved in the affirmative.\\nHon Members, although Mr J E Banda, MP, is not present in the House, I will proceed to address him in absentia. I have to inform you, Mr J E Banda, MP, that the House is extremely displeased with your utterances on Facebook page which was viewed by the general public and the world at large. Your utterances which were unsubstantiated reflected negatively on the House or its members. This conduct was not only disrespectful, but also brought the House into disrepute.\\nMr J E Banda, MP, as the former Independent Whip, you are aware or ought to be aware that the House has rules and procedures which ought to be followed. Such conduct falls below the expected conduct of an Hon Member. You, as an Hon Member of this august House, ought to know that your behaviour and conduct, both inside and outside the House, ought to be exemplary at all times and in all circumstances so as to enhance the dignity of the House. Further, I wish to inform Mr J E Banda, MP, that in accordance with section 28 (3) of the National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act, during the period of your suspension, you shall not:\\n1. enter the precincts of the Assembly, and this extends to the National Assembly Motel;\\n2. participate in an activity of the Assembly or any committee that you are assigned to, in your capacity as Member of Parliament; and\\n3. be paid the salary or allowance that you are entitled to as a Member.\\nI hope this will be the last time such undesirable conduct will be exhibited by yourself as a Member of this House.\\nI now order, Mr J E Banda, MP, to proceed on thirty (30) days suspension with effect from, today, Tuesday, 19th March to Wednesday 17th April, 2024, as resolved by the House.\\nSCENARIO 2\\nI think the \\u2018Noes\\u2019 have it.
